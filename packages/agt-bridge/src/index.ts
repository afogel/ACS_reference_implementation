 * conformance harness validates it against AGT's own schema at the pinned ref,
 * which is a stronger check than a hand-written mirror of it here and cannot
 * drift from upstream without the check saying so.
 *
 * `transformedPolicyTarget` is deliberately absent even though the SDK returns
 * it. The one caller recomputes the enforced identity from `policyInput` and

 * would give the check a way to agree with AGT without recomputing anything,

 * by holding AGT's vocabulary out of the Guardian. `Policy` says which bridge,
 * since "bridge" alone would not survive a second one.
 *

 * the SDK's `inputIdentity`, `enforcedIdentity` and `transformedPolicyTarget`
 * describe its own evaluation rather than this step's outcome, and are
 * confirmed against the SDK in this package's own test.
 *
 * `evaluateWithEvidence` is deliberately NOT here. Production's `evaluateStep`
 * tells `evaluate` and nothing else, so a role carrying both would make every
 * Guardian stand-in -- `StartGuardianOptions.bridge` is typed against this --
 * answer a measurement question production never asks. That is `EvidenceBridge`
 * below, which the conformance harness depends on and the Guardian does not.
 *
 * The snapshot type parameter lets a holder declare which messages it sends
 * (`PolicyBridge<AgtPreToolCallSnapshot>`) and be checked against that shape.

 * harness's identity check has no use for a bare verdict. `createBridge`
