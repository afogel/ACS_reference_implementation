/**
 * The host half of `handshake/hello`: send a ClientHello, keep what comes back
 * as this session's config.
 *
 * TWO ENTRY POINTS, AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM:
 *
 *   - `negotiateSessionConfig` does the exchange and THROWS. One request, one
 *     stored config, or an error naming which part failed.
 *   - `resolveSessionConfig` is what a host shim collaborates with: it is told
 *     "get me this session's config" and answers with a message -- the config
 *     to apply to this step, and whatever went wrong getting it. It never
 *     throws, and it never makes the caller ask an error object what it holds.
 *
 * That second one exists because the asking it replaces was load-bearing and
 * subtle (PR #12 review, Important). The shim used to run the negotiation
 * itself, catch, test `error instanceof SessionConfigNotStoredError`, and read
 * `error.config` off it to find out whether a posture had been negotiated
 * after all. Every host would have had to repeat that, and getting it wrong is
 * a fail-open: see the risk-row-14 note on `SessionConfigNotStoredError`.
 *
 * ONE NAME FOR THE STORED MESSAGE (PR #10 review, Important and naming
 * symmetry). This module speaks `SessionConfig` throughout -- the message a
 * host stores and reads its posture and timeout from -- and not `ServerHello`,
 * which is the Guardian's noun for what it emits
 * (packages/guardian/src/handshake.ts's `buildServerHello`). The two used to be
 * used interchangeably here for the same value, joined by
 * `as unknown as SessionConfig`: a rename dressed as a type, checking nothing.
 *
 * `SessionConfig` is the honest name on this side, because `isSessionConfig`
 * requires the two fields this host actually needs, not the five
 * handshake.json's ServerHello $def requires -- so naming the stored type after
 * the wire message would over-claim what this host validates, which is the same
 * defect as a type that claims a check it does not perform. That leaves
 * `ServerHello` a scoped noun rather than a second name for one message, and
 * the scope is exactly one thing: what the Guardian sent, before this host has
 * confirmed it can use it. `ServerHelloInvalidError` is named for the wire for
 * that reason -- the fault it reports IS the arrival ("the Guardian emitted the
 * wrong shape"), not the store. No stored value, field, or type is called a
 * ServerHello anywhere.
 *
 * `negotiateSessionConfig`, not `handshake`: the old name was one of four for a
 * single negotiation (`handshake` / `handshakeResponder` / `SessionConfig` /
 * `ServerHello`), and the least informative of them -- a bare wire verb that
 * said nothing about what the caller gets. This one names the message it
 * produces, matching the `<verb><Message>` shape of the Guardian's own half.
 *
 * V1 SCOPE -- stores only. Applying the negotiated posture (falling back
 * to `timeout_config` when the Guardian is slow or silent; recording a
 * fail-open audit event per `on_decision_failure: "proceed"`) is N6/N7,
 * and belongs to slice V3. That boundary is deliberate: this project keeps
 * a policy runtime's own evaluation-layer fail-closed behaviour distinct
 * from wire-delivery failure, and V3 is where the wire-delivery half
 * lands. This module does not retry and does not write to an audit sink --
 * it sends one request, stores one response, and returns or throws.
 *
 * V3: this call CAN time out (`HandshakeOptions.timeoutMs`, optional). It
 * has to -- there is no negotiated `timeout_config` yet at the point this
 * runs, so a caller with nothing else to bound it would otherwise hang on
 * a Guardian that accepts the connection and never answers, for exactly as
 * long as it takes Claude Code's own hook timeout to kill the process:
 * unaudited, and with nothing on stdout. What happens on a timeout (or any
 * other delivery failure) is still the caller's decision, not this
 * module's -- it only throws `GuardianTimeoutError`, same as
 * `guardianClient.post` always has; applying a posture to that throw is
 * N6/N7's job, one layer up.
 *
 * R3.2: this module knows ACS handshake vocabulary and JSON-RPC, nothing
 * else. It has no runtime dependency on the Guardian package -- it talks
 * to the Guardian only through the client role it is given, over the wire.

/**
 * Thrown when the Guardian answered and this session still ended up with no
 * STORED config -- as opposed to a handshake that never got an answer at all.
 * The two are materially different incidents and must not be squashed into one:
 *
 *   - A handshake that never reached the Guardian negotiated nothing. There
 *     is no posture to apply, and `posture_source: "default"` already says
 *     so.
 *   - A ServerHello that arrived and could not be *persisted* DID negotiate
 *     a posture. Persisting it is an optimisation for the hooks that come
 *     after this one (the shipped host runs each hook in a fresh
 *     subprocess, so the file is how a later process finds it); the value in
 *     hand is authoritative for the step that negotiated it. Discarding it
 *     because the write failed is how a deployment that declared
 *     `on_decision_failure: deny` fails *open* on the very step it just
 *     negotiated -- the fail-open shape this project keeps finding.
 *
 * `config` carries the negotiated config whenever there is one to carry, so a
 * caller can apply it to the current step and still report the persistence
 * failure. It is undefined only when there was never a usable config to begin
 * with, which is one of the two members below.
 *
 * ABSTRACT, so the family name is only ever the family (PR #12 review,
 * Important). This class used to mean two things at once -- "not stored" AND
 * "never a config" -- with the second reached through a `kind` parameter that
 * defaulted to the first. So `new SessionConfigNotStoredError(...)` read as
 * either the family or one specific member, and the default quietly picked one.
 * Now each member is its own class, each names its own `kind` with no default,
 * and the two names say which remedy applies: fix this host's disk
 * (`SessionConfigStoreFailedError`), or fix the Guardian's output
 * (`ServerHelloInvalidError`).
 *
 * What stays true of every member, and is why they share a root at all: the
 * Guardian answered, and nothing was stored. `classifySessionFailure` (N6)
 * reads the family's `kind` and is unaffected by which member it is handed, and
 * a caller that only wants the config to apply reads `.config` without a second
 * branch.
