/**
 * `governStep` -- the exchange that governs one step, for any host.
 *
 * A host shim tells this "resolve this attempt" and is told back what it
 * should write: the output, the decision that output renders, and which stage
 * of the exchange produced that decision. It asks nothing on the way, and it
 * holds no intermediate flags.
 *
 * This lives outside any host shim so the stage-tracking it does is not
 * something every host has to reproduce: each `try`/`catch` below knows its
 * own stage directly, rather than a shim re-deriving which stage failed by
 * inspecting boolean flags after something has already gone wrong.
 *
 * This is the one place the following properties are guaranteed. Each guards
 * against the same shape of fail-open -- something throws, silently no-ops, or
 * emits an output the host does not recognise, so the tool call runs
 * ungoverned and unaudited -- and each has a test that fails if it reopens:
 *
 *   - A decision that arrived always outranks a posture. A response carrying
 *     both an `error` and a `result` that names a decision means a decision
 *     arrived. `GuardianClient.requestDecision` is the one place that
 *     judgement is made, and it is made before any posture is consulted.
 *   - An evaluation failure and a delivery failure never merge. A `deny` the
 *     policy runtime produced -- including one it produced because its own
 *     evaluation failed -- is a decision, and travels the decision path. A
 *     silent Guardian or a dead transport is a delivery failure, and gets
 *     §6.4's negotiated `on_decision_failure`. Conflating them either breaks
 *     the policy layer's fail-closed invariant or halts production on a
 *     network blip.
 *   - An error carrying no decision is one or the other, and which one is not
 *     this function's call. A code meaning the Guardian was alive and refused
 *     the envelope fails closed regardless of posture; any other error is the
 *     wire's business and gets the posture. `applyFailurePosture` makes that
 *     distinction (see failure-kinds.ts), and every path here reaches it,
 *     which is why nothing here has to know the difference.
 *   - Every step that proceeds without a decision is audited (§6.4 MUST), and a
 *     `proceed` that could not be audited is downgraded to `deny`. That is
 *     `applyFailurePosture`'s job, and every path here that has no decision
 *     goes through it -- there is no route to an output that skips it.
 *   - The audit entry names the right incident. "No request was ever built",
 *     "a request went out and nothing came back", and "a decision arrived and
 *     this host could not express it" are three different incidents, filed
 *     under three `FailureStage`s. They are told apart by where in this
 *     function the failure was caught, not by re-reading flags after the fact:
 *     each stage has its own `try`, and each `catch` knows its own stage
 *     because that is the only stage it can be reached from.
 *   - A gate governs only the tools its hookmap entry names, and this module
 *     is where that rule is enacted (see `governsTool` below, and the skip at
 *     the top of `governStep`), not left to each host shim to remember. Each
 *     shim makes the same check itself, one call earlier, to save the cost of
 *     a step it will not govern; this module makes it again, on the tool the
 *     shim tells it (`GovernStepInput.scopedTool`), which is what a shim that
 *     never wrote its own check still gets -- provided it tells this function
 *     which tool the step is. A shim that reaches a `tools`-declaring gate
 *     without telling is refused outright rather than guessed at. What a
 *     skipped tool call costs downstream is not uniform -- see the four-row
 *     table on `GovernedStep`'s `"ungoverned"` member below for what an empty
 *     render actually does at each shipped applier and gate.
 *   - There are exactly three ways out: a `GovernedStep` for a step this gate
 *     governs, a `GovernedStep` for one it does not (`stage: "ungoverned"`, no
 *     decision, nothing asked and nothing audited), or a throw. A throw means
 *     this hookmap does not map the hook that fired (see the guard at the
 *     top of `governStep`), that it maps a result gate whose named output no
 *     replacement can be built for (see `assertOutputIsReplaceable`, asked
 *     before any decision is sought), or that the fallback render of a posture
 *     decision itself failed, which `loadHookmap` makes unreachable for a hook
 *     it does map (see `resolveByPosture` below) -- and all three are left as
 *     throws rather than repaired, because half an output is the one thing a
 *     governance hook must never write. The middle one is closed by ordering:
 *     asked any later it arrives with a decision in hand, and the posture
 *     answers a question the decision had already answered.
 *
 * This module knows ACS and hookmaps, and nothing else: no policy-runtime
 * vocabulary, and no host vocabulary -- it never names a field of the output
 * it returns, which is what lets the same function serve a second host with a
 * different wire shape (see render-decision.ts).

   *
   * This module has no independent way to know what a host calls its tools: a

   * request, no decision, and no audit entry. So the caller's word is

   * applied without its own measurement and its own decision about what a

   *
   * Optional because a gate can decline to scope at all: host #1 declares no
   * `tools` at either of its gates (its own settings.json matcher already
   * scopes both), so it has nothing to tell and nothing is checked. A caller
   * whose gate does declare a list and does not tell is refused outright,

   * which would silently skip a step this gate does govern.

       *     host #1 / result gate    exit 0, output written, tool result
       *                              delivered as the tool produced it. That
       *                              gate's applier supplies the wrapper itself,

       *                              for a clean result there.
       *     host #2 / request gate   no throw, nothing applied: the live
       *                              arguments object still carries its
       *                              original content, and the tool call runs.
       *     host #2 / result gate    no throw, nothing applied: the live result
       *                              object and its mirror still carry their
       *                              original content, and it is delivered.
       *
       * Zero audit entries in all four, necessarily -- this member is returned
       * before anything is audited.
       *
       * So an empty render guarantees nothing by itself: it does not mean the
       * step was stopped, and it does not mean anything recorded that the step
       * went ungoverned. On three of the four the tool call, or its output,
       * proceeds with no decision and no audit trail; on the fourth it is a
       * blocking stop, itself a side effect of that host's own rule against
       * writing half an output rather than a deliberate policy about skips.
       * Whether a skip is silent or loud is decided entirely in the applier --
       * host #1 answers it differently per gate, on purpose, and host #2's
       * applier simply has no branch for the case. That is host semantics,
       * which is exactly why this module has no opinion about it: it knows ACS
       * and hookmaps, nothing about what a given host does with an empty
       * render.

 * Does this gate govern this tool? -- `hookmap.hooks[hookEventName].tools`,
 * enacted. An entry with no `tools` key governs every tool, which is
 * `HookmapHookEntryCommon.tools`'s own contract (build-envelope.ts) and
 * host #1's own case: its hookmap declares no `tools` at either gate, because
 * its settings.json matcher (`^Bash$`) already scopes both.
 *
 * `tools` is shared hookmap vocabulary that build-envelope.ts shape-checks at
 * load time (`assertToolsWellFormed`) and normalises (`normalizeTools`), but
 * enforcing what it means -- skipping a tool call it does not name -- has to
 * live somewhere both hosts share, or a new host built from an existing shim
 * would load a `tools` list and govern every tool anyway. This function is
 * that shared enforcement, the same division `outputs.mirrors` has between
 * build-envelope.ts (shape) and result-output.ts (use).
 *
 * What a skip costs: a tool call this gate does not govern at all. Nothing
 * stands between the model and that tool call at this gate -- a real gap, not
 * a formality.
 *
 * Why it is right anyway: a deployment's own policy configuration (this
 * repo's `policy/manifest.yaml`, outside this package) can bind evaluation to
 * a single fixed target, checked before any of that deployment's own authored
 * rules run, so a tool it never registered is denied there by the shape
 * mismatch alone, never by a rule a policy author wrote. Asking anyway would
 * not govern that tool call; it would deny it and call the denial governance.
 * A gate that declines to ask is the honest answer to "this deployment cannot
 * express a policy question for this tool".
 *
 * A tool this returns `false` for must never reach the rest of `governStep`
 * to be answered by the deployment's negotiated posture -- that would be the
 * same fail-open shape this module exists to prevent elsewhere, one call
 * later. Both callers therefore return before any envelope is built:
 * `governStep`'s own skip below, and each host shim's own check, one call
 * earlier, which additionally returns before it validates a session id or
 * negotiates a session config, so an out-of-scope tool costs no handshake
 * either. The shim's own check saves that work; this module's check is what a
 * shim that never wrote one still gets, provided it tells `governStep` which
 * tool the step is (`GovernStepInput.scopedTool`) -- see that field's own doc
 * comment for why the tool named here is always the caller's word, never
 * re-derived from the hookmap's own paths against the payload.
 *
 * `entry.tools` needs no further null-handling here: `loadHookmap` returns a
 * normalised hookmap in which a `tools` key written bare in YAML (which
 * parses to `null` -- present and unusable, not absent) comes back omitted,
 * so this function only ever sees it absent or as the non-empty array of
 * non-empty strings `assertToolsWellFormed` already accepted. A `Hookmap`
 * built by hand, bypassing `loadHookmap`, is off contract for this field the
 * same way it is for every other one.
 *
 * `hasOwnProperty`, not a bare index, because `hookEventName` reaches some
 * hosts from their own payloads and `hooks["toString"]` resolves to an
 * inherited `Object.prototype` function rather than `undefined`. Today that
 * changes no answer -- that function carries no `tools` field, so a bare
 * index would report "governs every tool" too, and the caller would go on to
 * the same `governStep` guard that throws on an unmapped hook. This is a
 * hazard kept closed rather than one reopened: the answer stays a property of
 * the hookmap's own entries, not of what `Object.prototype` happens to carry.

   * write one.
   *
   * Named for the posture because that is what answers almost every failure
   * that reaches it, and the one exception is deliberately not this function's
   * business: a Guardian that refused the envelope fails closed regardless of
   * posture, decided inside `applyFailurePosture`, so nothing here branches on
   * it and nothing here can forget to.
   *
   * The rendering here cannot fail: `loadHookmap` does not merely check that
   * `allow` and `deny` are present in every hook's `decisions` block, it
   * shape-checks every entry it accepts (`assertRenderableDecisions`), and
   * `applyFailurePosture` never returns any decision but those two -- and the
   * guard at the top of `governStep` has already established that this hook has
   * a block at all. So this cannot recurse into itself, and a throw escaping it
   * means the hookmap bypassed the loader -- which is the caller's problem to
   * fail loudly on, not something to paper over.
   *
   * There is one way this can throw beyond the rendering itself: a negotiated
   * fail-closed `deny` at a result gate has to withhold the output, and building
   * the replacement that withholds it can fail (see `replacingOutput`). Exactly
   * one route reaches that, and it is the one route where a posture is consulted
   * before `assertOutputIsReplaceable` has run: a stage-"request" failure, i.e. a
   * payload that does not carry what this hook's `outputs` block describes at
   * all. That is a posture deny this host cannot carry out, and the honest
   * answers are a loud stop or a block that withholds nothing while claiming to.
   * It throws, and the caller turns that into a blocking stop. Every other route
   * -- a leaf that is present and is not prose above all -- is refused before a
   * decision is sought rather than answered here, because there it would be
   * answering with a posture something a decision had already answered.
   *
   * `method` is the ACS method or null, never the host's own event name: an
   * envelope that could not be built has no ACS method to report, and the audit
   * log is read by consumers that know only ACS. Putting a host event name here
   * made `bun run inspector` -- whose whole claim is that it names no host --
   * print one at runtime.
