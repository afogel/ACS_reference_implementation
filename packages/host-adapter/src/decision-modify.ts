 * `resolveModify` all share the same shape --
 * `resolve<Disposition>(decision, ...) -> ValidatedAcsDecision`, never
 * throwing, each in a module beside the knowledge it needs -- and
 * `validateDecision` is the switch that dispatches to them and nothing else.
 *
 * The translation from "this rewrite cannot be honoured" to "deny" stays
 * here rather than moving down into modifications.ts, which owns §6.3 and
 * owns no decision vocabulary at all.
 *
 * This module knows ACS's decision vocabulary and §6.3's apply step. No

/**
 * Applies a `modify`'s rewrite to the ACS-side document the decision's pointers
 * address, or denies.
 *
 * Its own module, beside decision-expiry.ts's two resolvers, because the
 * three dispositions are peers that must each fail closed on their own
 * terms -- see this module's header. What follows is what the resolver
 * itself has to get right.
 *
 * `applyModifications` throws rather than half-applying, and this
 * is the one place that turns such a throw into a decision -- deliberately
 * here rather than in modifications.ts, which owns §6.3 and owns no decision
 * vocabulary at all.
 *
 * A throw that is *not* a `ModificationsInvalidError` becomes the same deny
 * rather than escaping: an unexpected failure inside the apply step is still a
 * rewrite that did not happen, and letting it propagate would leave the host
 * with a `modify` it never applied, or with no decision at all. Fail closed
 * either way, with whatever the failure said as the audited reason.
 *
 * Its message, never its `toString()`, whatever class it is: what lands
 * here is read in the transcript and written to the audit trail, and a deny
 * is only as useful as its stated reason.
 *
 * What neither gate asks is whether the applied document differs from the
 * one it was applied to, and at the request gate nothing downstream asks
 * either. A `modify` whose `parameter_overrides` set an argument to the
 * value it already held, or whose redaction replaces one with itself,
 * applies cleanly and returns an `applied_input` identical to what went out
 * on the wire. Measured: `parameter_overrides: {command: "cat .env"}`
 * against `{command: "cat .env"}` returns `modify` with `applied_input
 * {"command":"cat .env"}` -- the policy said rewrite, nothing was rewritten,
 * the original command runs, and the audit trail says the decision was
 * honoured. That is this branch's own fail-open family, one gate over from
 * the result gate, where `projectAppliedOutput`'s landing check refuses the
 * same shape.
 *
 * This is not closed here, because the honest repair is bigger than the
 * hole. A leaf-shaped check has no analogue at this gate: a request payload
 * has no single leaf, so "did anything change" would have to be "did every
 * modification change the document at its own target" -- a per-modification
 * comparison, in `modifications.ts`'s apply step where both documents and
 * every target are in hand. That check would also close the result gate's
 * remaining bundled case (see `projectAppliedOutput`), which is the argument
 * for doing it once, there, rather than twice by gate. What makes it safe to
 * defer rather than urgent: `mapVerdict` synthesizes one override from the
 * bound `$policy_target` and throws otherwise, so no Guardian in this
 * deployment emits a no-change rewrite, and the failure is a false record
 * rather than a bypass of a decision that arrived.
 *
 * The projection is inside this try, deliberately. At a result gate the
 * applied document still has to be projected onto the output object the
 * host holds (`projectAppliedOutput`), and that projection can fail for
 * reasons of exactly the same kind as the apply itself -- a leaf the payload
 * does not have, a replacement of a type the host's output shape does not
 * admit. Both are a rewrite that did not land, so both belong to the same
 * sentence: `deny`, `modifications_invalid`. Projecting after this function
 * returns would put those failures outside the only catch that can answer
 * them with a decision, where a caller's delivery-failure posture would
 * answer them instead -- and a `proceed` posture there is an unredacted
 * output delivered because a redaction could not be expressed. Fail-closed
 * by construction, not by posture.
