   * orthogonal to which payload shape that gate builds, and host #2 needs it
   * at BOTH gates, for two different reasons.
   *
   *   - The RESULT gate (`tool.execute.after`) needs it because its own
   *     `outputs`/`exit_status` paths are shaped per tool: host #2's hooks
   *     fire for every tool with no matcher, and the raw payload field those
   *     paths read is a DIFFERENT shape per tool (measured on OpenCode
   *     1.18.15: only `bash` carries the fields `outputs`/`exit_status`
   *     below are written for; other tools carry an unrelated shape those
   *     paths were never meant to read). A path that does not resolve for
   *     the arriving tool is a hookmap fault this gate must not try to
   *     govern with.
   *   - The REQUEST gate (`tool.execute.before`) needs it for a different
   *     reason, found only after this field was scoped to the result gate
   *     alone: this gate's own `$.` paths resolving for every tool was
   *     mistaken for "so it governs every tool" -- but resolving THIS
   *     module's paths and resolving a deployment's own policy configuration
   *     are different questions. A deployment's policy configuration
   *     (policy/manifest.yaml, outside this package) can bind its
   *     evaluation to a single fixed target, checked before any of that
   *     deployment's own authored rules run; a tool call this deployment
   *     never registered, or whose arguments that fixed target does not
   *     resolve against, is refused there by the shape mismatch alone, never
   *     by an authored rule. Measured against this repo's own shipped
   *     configuration: every tool but the one name it registers denies,
   *     unconditionally, before a rule is ever consulted. Asking a
   *     deployment configured that way is not wrong, but the answer it gives
   *     is a configuration mismatch reported as if it were governance.
   *     `tools` here lets a host shim decline to ask at all for a tool its
   *     own deployment cannot express a target for.
   *
   * Whether a given invocation's tool is actually IN this list is the host
   * shim's concern (each gate honouring it), never this module's --

 * means shaped like render-decision.ts's own `DecisionRenderRule`: a
 * non-null object carrying a non-empty `output` block, every field of which
 * names its own source. Presence alone is not enough to guarantee that:
 * `allow: null` still satisfies `"allow" in decisions`, and then
 * renderDecision throws on the non-object entry; `allow: {}` also satisfies
 * it and renders an output whose one field is `undefined`, which
 * `JSON.stringify` then drops entirely -- stdout ends up with no decision in
 * it at all, defeating "always a decision on stdout" exactly as surely as a
 * missing entry does, just more quietly.
 *
 * The minimum is applied per hook, because the posture answers a delivery
 * failure at whichever gate suffered it: a hook missing `allow` or
 * `deny` is a hook whose posture answer cannot be rendered, and one gate
 * having both says nothing about the other. A hook declaring no `decisions`
 * block at all is rejected here for the same reason, named, rather than
 * discovered by the first step that gate ever governs.
 *
 * Every declared entry is checked here, not only `allow` and `deny`: a
 * malformed `modify` (or `ask`, or `defer`) entry would otherwise only
 * surface when a Guardian actually returns that decision, and by then the
 * throw lands inside the shim's own catch, gets treated as a delivery
 * failure, and the posture answers it as a fail-open proceed -- an
 * arriving policy decision silently degraded into the exact bypass this
 * project exists to remove. Checking every entry at load time closes that
 * before it can happen, for the cost of one loop.
 *
 * What this actually guarantees, once it passes: every entry `loadHookmap`
 * accepted is renderable. That is what lets a caller's own fallback render
 * of `applyFailurePosture`'s "allow"/"deny" output be trusted never to
 * throw -- not because `allow` and `deny` merely exist, but because
 * existing here means shape-checked here.
 *
 * What "shape-checked" means is the hookmap's own declarative output shape:
 * an entry carries a non-empty `output` block, and every
 * field in it names either a literal `value` or a non-empty `from`. It is
 * deliberately not a check for any particular host field -- this module names
 * none, and test/invariants.test.ts gates that -- so the check is that the
 * rule is renderable, not that it renders anything in particular.

 *
 * A request payload's pointers address its arguments: `/env/TOKEN` names an
 * argument field, so the document is the unwrapped bag above and the applied
 * result is a tool input the host can run.
 *
 * A result payload's pointers address the payload itself: the pointer for
 * the leaf that went out is `/outputs/0/value`, which names nothing inside
 * an arguments bag -- there isn't one at this step, and inventing one was
 * never an option (see `unwrapArguments`'s own note). So the document is the
 * payload, and the pointer resolves against exactly the structure the far
 * end evaluated and named.
 *
 * A shallow copy, never the payload object itself: the apply step returns a
 * new object but reads this one, and an envelope is also what the audit and
 * envelope logs record. Nothing downstream of a decision may reach back
 * into the message that asked for it.
 *
 * The applied result is not what a result-gate host delivers -- the ACS
 * payload carries one leaf where the host's own output object carries that
