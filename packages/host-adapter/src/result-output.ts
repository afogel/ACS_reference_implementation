/**
 * The result gate's replacing output: how a decision about what a step
 * produced reaches a host in a shape the host will actually accept.
 *
 * The hazard this module exists for: a host that lets a hook replace a
 * tool's output validates the replacement against that tool's own output
 * schema, and a replacement that does not match it is discarded silently,
 * with the original delivered. Verified by hand against the first host wired
 * to this gate -- a hook answering with the redacted text alone, as a bare
 * string, produced a warning line on stderr while the model received the
 * real secret. So a redaction is only a redaction if every sibling field
 * survives.
 *
 * The way that is achieved, and there is deliberately only one: patch a
 * clone of the object the host handed us, at the path the hookmap named.
 * Never construct a new output object. That symmetry is the whole answer --
 * the shape is preserved because it was never rebuilt, so a field this
 * adapter has never heard of survives exactly as well as one it has.
 *
 * The ACS document is not simply handed back, because the ACS result
 * payload carries one leaf -- `outputs[0].value`, the leaf the hookmap's
 * `outputs.from` names -- where the host's own output object carries that
 * leaf and its siblings. §6.3's pointers address the ACS payload
 * (`/outputs/0/value`), and that is what they are applied to; this module
 * then projects the applied leaf back through `outputs.from` into a clone of
 * `outputs.within`. The two notations stay deliberately separate: nothing
 * here reinterprets an ACS pointer as a host-side path, because the
 * agreement that keeps them aligned is a declaration the policy side owns,
 * not a translation this side could check.
 *
 * This module knows ACS's decision vocabulary, ACS's result payload shape,
 * and a hookmap's `outputs` block. It names no host field and no policy
 * runtime -- the field names in the object it clones are the host's own,
 * copied without being read, which is exactly what lets a second host reuse
 * it.

 * The one way a replacing output is ever built: a clone of the object at

 *
 * Every failure mode is a throw, because each means the replacement would be a
 * shape the host may decline, and a declined replacement delivers the original.
 * A redaction that does not land is a failure, not a partial success:
 *
 *   - the two paths not describing one leaf inside one object -- `within`'s
 *     segments not being the leading segments of `from`'s. The leaf's path inside
 *     the container is `from` minus `within`, so a pair that does not stand in
 *     that relation has no leaf to take.
 *   - `within` resolving to something that is not an object, or the leaf being
 *     absent from it. There is nothing to clone, or nothing to patch.
 *   - a replacement of a different `typeof` than the value it replaces. Prose
 *     in place of prose preserves the shape; prose in place of a number,
 *     an object or a list does not, and writing it would produce exactly the
 *     silently-discarded replacement this module exists to prevent.
 *
 *     Both directions of that mismatch are reachable, and the one reachable
 *     here is the replacement's, not the leaf's. `Redaction.replacement?:
 *     string` is a TypeScript type on a value that arrives over the wire, and
 *     nothing checks it at runtime. A Guardian sending `{path:
 *     "/outputs/0/value", replacement: 42}` reaches this comparison with a
 *     number for a string leaf and gets `deny(modifications_invalid)` -- an
 *     arriving decision this gate cannot carry out, answered as a decision,
 *     which is what this comparison is for. The other direction, a leaf that
 *     is not prose, no longer reaches a decision at all:
 *     `assertOutputIsReplaceable` refuses the deployment for it before one is
 *     sought, because a leaf no replacement can be expressed for is not a
 *     decision to answer, it is a hookmap that could not carry one out.
 *
 * None of this is assumed away: the path relation is checked here rather
 * than inherited from `buildEnvelope`'s check on the raw strings. This
 * function is handed a payload and two paths; "some caller checked" is not a
 * property of a function, and on one live route it is not even true --
 * `resolveByPosture` calls this on the stage-"request" path, where
 * `buildEnvelope` failed and may have failed on exactly that check. What the
 * caller contributes is order, not trust: `assertOutputIsReplaceable` runs
 * every check below before a decision is sought, so no failure here can

/**

 * clone, a leaf to patch, and a leaf whose own type prose can stand in for --
 * and not one of them depends on which decision arrives. Asked once a

 * delivers the unredacted output and drops the decision, `deny` there blocks
 * with nothing withheld. Both are the shape this module exists to prevent,
 * arrived at from the other side.
 *
 * So the question is asked first, where the only answer needed is a loud
 * stop. A hookmap that cannot express a withholding for the payload in hand
 * is a broken deployment, not a policy question -- the same class as a
 * hookmap that will not load -- and nothing has been asked of a policy
 * runtime and nothing has been audited at that point, so there is no
 * decision to drop and no record to falsify.
 *
 * It asks by building one, rather than by re-stating what building one
 * requires. "A replacement can be built" and "here is what building a
 * replacement needs" are two sentences that can drift, and this check's
 * whole value is that the projection and its precondition cannot come apart.
 * `WITHHELD_OUTPUT` is not a stand-in either: it is the exact value the
 * fail-closed path would have to patch, so what is checked is the very
 * projection that would be performed. The clone is discarded -- the answer
 * is in whether it could be made.

/**
 * The applied ACS result payload, projected onto the host's own output object:
 * §6.3's rewrite, landed where the host reads it.
 *
 * Named `projectAppliedOutput` rather than `appliedOutput`: the old name was
 * the field it fills -- `ValidatedAcsDecision.applied_output` -- while the
 * function projects the applied document onto the host's shape and then asks
 * whether the rewrite reached the leaf at all. Its sibling `applyModifications`
 * already means "apply §6.3", so two functions sharing a stem would do
 * different jobs without either name saying which. The verb here is the
 * projection; the landing check is the question the projection has to answer
 * before it can claim to have landed, which is why it stays inside rather
 * than beside.
 *
 * The leaf is read back from `outputs[0].value` -- the one place `buildEnvelope`
 * put it, from the same `outputs.from` path this projects it back through. The
 * two halves are symmetric on purpose: one path in the hookmap, one leaf on the
 * wire, one leaf patched back.
 *
 * Called from inside `resolveModify`'s apply step, so a throw here becomes
 * `deny(modifications_invalid)` -- the same answer as a rewrite that could
 * not be applied at all, for the same reason: a rewrite the host cannot land
 * is a rewrite that did not happen, and reporting it as applied is the one
 * outcome that is worse than denying.
 *
 * The last way a rewrite can fail to land is by landing somewhere else,
 * which is the one failure the projection cannot report by failing, because
 * it does not fail. §6.3's pointers address the whole ACS result payload,
 * and that payload has fields beside the one leaf this gate carries: a
 * redaction of `/exit_status` or `/tool/name`, or an override of
 * `exit_status` or of `tool` wholesale, is honourable, has a real target,
 * and applies exactly as written. (`parameter_overrides` keys are single
 * top-level names, never pointers, so `/tool/name` itself cannot be
 * overridden -- only `tool` as a whole.) `outputs[0].value` then comes back
 * untouched, the projection patches the leaf with the value already there,
 * and the replacement is the object the host is already holding. Measured:
 * the host was handed the tool's own output, secret and all, beside a
 * decision reporting a redaction and an explanation saying so.
 *
 * So the question asked here is whether the rewrite reached the leaf, not
 * whether its pointer looked like the leaf's. Comparing pointers would have
 * to decide what an ancestor pointer means -- an override replacing the
 * whole `outputs` array does reach the leaf, and does land (measured) --
 * and even then it could only say the pointer covers the leaf, never that
 * the value under it changed, which is the half that catches an ancestor
 * override carrying the value already there (also measured). The comparison
 * below asks the projection's own inputs, so it cannot drift from the
 * projection, which is `assertOutputIsReplaceable`'s argument for probing by
 * building rather than by re-stating.
 *
 * What it therefore does not ask is whether every modification landed, and
 * the difference is reachable. It asks about one leaf, so a `modifications`
 * object bundling a leaf edit with a non-leaf one passes: the leaf changed,
 * the non-leaf edit was silently dropped, and the whole `modify` is reported
 * applied. Measured, all four -- a leaf redaction beside a `/exit_status`
 * redaction, beside an `exit_status` override, beside a `/tool/name`
 * redaction, and an `outputs` override carrying a second element that
 * nothing projects. Each of those non-leaf edits alone is correctly denied.
 * No secret reaches the model, since the leaf redaction did land, so what
 * this leaves is a false audit and transcript record, not an unredacted
 * delivery -- but it is a best-effort partial apply reported as a full one,
 * which modifications.ts's own header forbids, reached one seam later than
 * that header can see. Recorded rather than closed: the check that would
 * close it is per-modification and belongs in the apply step, where both
 * documents and every target are in hand, and it would close the request
 * gate's identical hole at the same time (see validate-decision.ts's own
 * note). `mapVerdict` emits exactly one redaction, so this bundle cannot
 * produce it -- the same reachability class as the case this function does
 * refuse, which is exactly why neither is left to the bundle's good
 * behaviour.
 *
 * `===` is exact equality for a prose leaf, and that is a call-site
 * invariant rather than a property of this function. Every route through
 * `governStep` passes `assertOutputIsReplaceable` -- which refuses a leaf
 * `WITHHELD_OUTPUT` is not the same `typeof` as -- before a decision is
 * sought, so the leaf reaching here is a string and `===` is value equality.
 * Stated as the invariant it is because this module insists elsewhere that
 * "some caller checked" is not a property of a function, and because of what
 * breaking it would cost: for an object leaf `===` becomes reference
 * equality, so a structurally identical replacement would read as a change
 * and be reported applied -- a fail-open, not merely a weak comparison. Left
 * stated rather than closed, the way `withResultOutput`'s modify-throw is: a
 * host with such a leaf needs this comparison taught about its shape, the
 * same way the projection would need teaching about arrays, and neither is
 * machinery for a case the preflight refuses first.
 *
 * What this refuses that a policy author might not expect: a redaction
 * whose `replacement` is the value the leaf already held. Nothing about it
 * is malformed and its pointer is the right one -- and it is refused
 * anyway, because what this gate can observe is the object the host will be
 * handed, and that object is the one the tool produced. A Guardian that
 * wants the output delivered as produced has `allow` for exactly that; a
 * `modify` this host cannot tell apart from one is not a rewrite it can
 * report as applied. An over-refusal on the safe side, deliberately, and
 * the same side as the preflight's.
