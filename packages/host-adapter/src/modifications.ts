 * §6.3's `modifications`: what makes one honourable, and what applying it
 * does to the ACS document that actually went out on the wire. Extracted from
 * validate-decision.ts's `validateDecision`, which sequences this job rather
 * than owning it.
 *
 * Which document that is belongs to the caller and never to this module:
 * the arguments a step was asked to run with at a gate that decides whether it
 * runs, the result payload it produced at a gate that sees what it produced --
 * `modificationDocumentOf` is where the choice is made. Everything here is the same
 * job either way, because a JSON pointer against a structured document does not
 * care which document it is. The parameter is still called `modificationDocument`,
 * which is the narrower of the two; the refusals it produces are worded for
 * both, because those are read by a human in an audit trail.
 *
 * A `modify` whose `modifications` cannot be applied exactly as written is a
 * DENY at the caller, never a best-effort partial apply and never a
 * reported-but-unapplied one. This module's half of that contract is to throw
 * rather than return something half-done. That covers §6.3's composition
 * rules (`modified_content` combined with structured edits, or a `redactions`
 * path overlapping a `parameter_overrides` key) and, just as load-bearing,
 * every way a target can fail to be there: a pointer that addresses no field,
 * a path or override key naming an argument the Guardian never saw, a path
 * descending through an array at anything other than one of its real
 * elements, and a prototype-reserved segment. Each of those would otherwise
 * report a successful `modify` while the original argument -- the
 * un-redacted one -- is what the host actually runs.
 *
 * This module knows ACS's `modifications` shape and the ACS document its
 * pointers address, nothing else -- no policy-runtime vocabulary, no host
 * vocabulary, and no decision vocabulary either. What an unhonourable `modifications` means for
 * the *decision* is validate-decision.ts's sentence to say, which is why
 * nothing here returns a decision or names one.

 * source carrying a shared package's security invariant because the package
 * had no shared definition to export (§V5 review round 3, Task 3,
 * "duplication vs wrong abstraction"). It is now the one predicate every
 * one of those files imports instead -- see its own doc comment for why the
 * underlying name list stays a module-private `Set` rather than being
 * exported itself (fix round 1, Minor 1).
 *
 * THIS MODULE'S OWN CHECK STAYS LOCAL, THOUGH -- unlike the name list, the
 * check below is not shared with `apply-host-output.ts`'s, because the two
 * check different things. `assertNoReservedSegments` here takes NAMES
 * already in hand -- a redaction path already split into segments, or one
 * override object's own top-level keys -- and asks "is this name reserved",
 * the same structural job `hookmap-path.ts`'s `pathSegments` and
 * `render-decision.ts`'s `place` do against their own path notations. It is
 * not a walk into an arbitrarily nested VALUE, so it is not
 * `reserved-segments.ts`'s exported `findReservedKey` (that walker is for a
 * caller examining a value it is about to trust as a whole, at any depth --
 * see its own doc comment) with a shorter argument list; it is the other
 * job, staying separate for the identical reason PR #13's review response
 * gave for keeping `render-decision.ts`'s path check out of a shared
 * resolver: folding a name check into a value walker "would have merged two
 * path languages rather than de-duplicating one".
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL TRUE, IN ISOLATION: `setAtPath` (below) assigns into a
 * fresh clone of the caller's arguments at every level it descends through,
 * never into a shared prototype -- a `modify` applied through THIS module
 * alone cannot pollute anything global, on any host, today or previously.
 *
 * WHAT STOPPED BEING TRUE, AND WHY (§V5 review, fix round 2, Critical). This
 * comment used to read "no global pollution is reachable today" as a
 * system-wide claim, on the strength of the paragraph above -- true of
 * `setAtPath` in isolation, but never a claim this module could make about
 * every host built on it. This guard checks `redactions[].path` and
 * `parameter_overrides`' KEYS; it never checks the VALUE an override entry
 * carries, which arrives verbatim off the Guardian's own wire (see
 * `applyModifications`'s own comment on `setAtPath`'s stable-serialisation
 * claim, which draws the identical distinction for the identical reason).
 * Parsed through `JSON.parse` rather than built with object-literal syntax,
 * an object-valued override can carry an ordinary OWN key literally named
 * `__proto__` -- `JSON.parse` never sets the real `[[Prototype]]` link, only
 * a same-named data property -- and this module passes that value through to
 * `applied_input`/`applied_output` unexamined (R3.2: it walks the ACS
 * document's own structure, not an arriving decision's arbitrary nesting).
 * That was always true of this module. It stopped being the whole story the
 * moment a SECOND host existed whose own applier reads a rendered value back
 * through the JavaScript prototype chain rather than only ever assigning it
 * shallowly: `hosts/opencode/apply-host-output.ts`'s `mergeInPlace` recurses
 * into any field present on both sides as a plain object, and reading
 * `target["__proto__"]` on a plain object with no OWN `__proto__` resolves
 * through the chain to `Object.prototype` itself -- so the recursive call
 * that follows writes through it, global to that host's whole long-lived
 * plugin process, for a value this module let through untouched.
 *
 * WHERE THE GUARD THAT CLOSES IT NOW LIVES: `reserved-segments.ts`'s
 * exported `findReservedKey`, called from every host applier that recurses
 * into a rendered value the way `apply-host-output.ts`'s `mergeInPlace`
 * does (`apply-host-output.ts`'s own `applyHostOutput`, pass 1, over the
 * rendered `args`/`result` value as a whole tree, before its recursive merge
 * ever runs on it -- see that file's own doc comment). Not
 * `hosts/opencode/`'s own source, any longer: a shared package pointing at
 * one host's file for a security invariant was the wrong abstraction, and
 * the walker now lives beside the name list, in this package, for whichever
 * host applier needs it to import. This module still may not host
 * that guard itself: closing this gap means recursing into a VALUE this
 * module never builds -- the rendered `args`/`result` a host applier merges
 * onto its own live objects -- which is a fact about what a host's applier
 * does with a value after this module has already returned it, not about

 * said rewrite, nothing was rewritten, and the audit trail said the decision
 * was honoured. Asked here, gate-agnostically, rather than "did the whole
 * document change" at either gate: a document-level check would miss a
 * no-op target bundled beside a real one, and a request payload has no
 * single leaf the way a result payload does, so there is no narrower
 * question to ask there instead.
 *
 * IT ALSO SUBSUMES THE SINGLE-TARGET FORM of `projectAppliedOutput`'s own
 * landing check at the result gate (a redaction or override whose only
 * target is the one leaf that gate projects, replaced with the value
 * already there) -- this function now refuses that before the projection is
 * ever attempted, which is why that check's docstring is worded as a
 * fallback rather than the first word on it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT CLOSE is the result gate's OTHER hole: a `modify`
 * bundling a leaf edit that changes its own target with a non-leaf edit
 * that ALSO changes its own target, where the leaf edit lands and the
 * non-leaf one is silently unobservable because nothing beyond that one
 * leaf is ever projected onto the host's output object. Every target in
 * such a bundle genuinely changes -- this function's own question, asked
 * per target, answers "yes" to each of them -- so there is nothing for a
 * document-agnostic check to catch here; telling a target that changed but
 * did not LAND apart from one that changed and did needs to know which
 * target is the leaf, which is gate-specific knowledge this module does not
 * have and R3.2 does not let it acquire. That closing is
 * `projectAppliedOutput`'s own, in `result-output.ts`, which already knows
 * the leaf and now also asks whether anything ELSE about the document
 * changed alongside it.

  // WHAT THE STABLE-SERIALISATION CLAIM COVERS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
  // `modificationDocument` and `result` are both built by spreads from the

  // CONTAINER this walks through -- everything besides the target's own
  // value -- keeps the key order it already had, on both sides. The VALUE AT
  // THE TARGET is not covered by that: for a redaction's `replacement` or a
  // `parameter_overrides` entry, that value arrives verbatim from the
  // Guardian's own JSON, in whatever key order it was written, never derived
  // from `modificationDocument`'s -- there is nothing here to keep stable.
  //
  // THE RESIDUAL THIS LEAVES: an object-valued replacement whose keys are
  // permuted from the original's, but is otherwise identical, reads as
  // CHANGED. `parameter_overrides: {env: {B: 2, A: 1}}` against
  // `{env: {A: 1, B: 2}}` is semantically a no-op and this check does not
  // catch it -- a narrowed remainder of the defect class this post-condition
  // exists to close (the prior behaviour missed every no-change
  // modification; this misses only a permuted-key one). NOT a guarantee
  // about this function, only about what reaches it today (`setAtPath`'s own
  // note above makes the same distinction, for the same reason): this
  // deployment's policy runtime synthesizes `parameter_overrides` bound to a
  // single named argument rather than emitting an arbitrary Guardian-authored
  // object there, so an object-valued override is not something it produces
  // -- the same reachability class as the cases this check does refuse, and
  // the same reason those were still worth guarding. Canonicalising key
  // order would close it, and is deliberately not done here: that is a
  // behaviour change with its own hazards, for a case nothing reachable
  // needs closed.
  //
  // A replacement EQUAL to the value already there is refused too, not only
  // a replacement that resolves to the identical reference. That is the
  // ruling on what a legitimately no-change `modifications` means, and it is
  // this project's own precedent: `projectAppliedOutput` already refuses the
  // same shape for the one leaf a result gate can see. A Guardian that wants
  // the document delivered as produced has `allow` for exactly that, and a
  // `modify` this function cannot tell apart from one is not a rewrite it
  // can report as applied. An over-refusal, on the safe side, and the same
  // side as every other refusal in this module.
