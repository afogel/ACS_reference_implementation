/**
 * applyFailurePosture handles the delivery half of ACS's two-failure-domain
 * split: evaluation failures fail closed on their own; this handles a
 * failure of the wire itself, by applying the negotiated posture.
 *
 * This function is only ever reached when NO usable decision arrived: the
 * Guardian stayed silent past the negotiated timeout, the transport died, or
 * an error response carried no decision. §6.4 says all three resolve the
 * same way -- apply the deployment's declared posture -- and that every step
 * which proceeds without a decision MUST be audited.
 *
 * With ONE exception, which is not §6.4's case at all, and which is why this
 * module now reads the failure before it reads the posture: a JSON-RPC error
 * whose code means the Guardian was alive and REFUSED this envelope. §6.4 is
 * about a decision that failed to arrive; a refusal is a decision withheld,
 * by the very component this host defers to. So a refusal resolves to `deny`
 * regardless of posture, and is still audited. Without that, a live Guardian
 * answering `-32020 evaluation failed` and a dead socket were the same kind,
 * and under the shipped default posture (`proceed`) both became `allow` --
 * a governance tool proceeding on the Guardian's own "no". See
 * REFUSAL_RPC_CODES for which codes mean that, and why the set is enumerated.
 *
 * It is NOT reached when a decision arrived. A `deny` that arrives is
 * honoured regardless of posture, and that is enforced by the caller never
 * calling this on a decision.
 *
 * §6.4 makes the audit entry a MUST for a step that proceeds without a
 * decision, and the audit sink is documented total -- it must never throw,
 * delay a decision, or change one, even when it cannot write. Those two
 * properties can disagree: when the write genuinely fails, the entry MUST
 * exist but the sink cannot make it exist. This function resolves that by
 * downgrading a `proceed` it could not audit to `deny`, with its own reason
 * code -- an unauditable bypass is not a bypass the spec permits. The sink's
 * own contract is untouched: it still never throws, never delays a decision,
 * and never changes one; the change is entirely in what this caller does
 * with a write it was told did not happen.
 *
 * Nothing here knows the policy runtime behind the wire. A delivery failure
 * is a property of the wire, and a refusal is a property of the Guardian's
 * willingness to answer this envelope -- neither is a property of whatever
 * evaluates policy on the other side of it, and nothing here names one.

 * Declared here by value rather than imported: this package has no runtime

 * -- the same arrangement DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS keeps with the Guardian's
 * declared default. The four are the complete set this deployment's Guardian
 * mints for a request it will not decide (packages/guardian/src/server.ts):
 *
 *   -32700  Parse error. Nothing the host sent was JSON. Answered with
 *           `id: null`, since there is no envelope to read an id out of --
 *           which is why guardian-client.ts's post() has to let an
 *           unaddressed error through before its id-correlation check, or
 *           this code could never reach this function at all.
 *   -32010  The envelope failed schema validation and the Guardian could not
 *           address a deny decision to it (no top-level id, or an id it
 *           cannot put in a response), or the body exceeded the Guardian's
 *           request cap. denyOnInvalidEnvelope converts the ADDRESSABLE
 *           steps/* cases into honoured denies Guardian-side; this closes the
 *           rest from the host's own side, which is what makes the
 *           Guardian's inability to address every deny non-load-bearing.
 *   -32011  The Guardian dispatched no handler for the method.
 *   -32020  Evaluation itself failed -- mapVerdict's own checks, a policy
 *           runtime error, or the outer net around dispatch.
 *
 * -32011 is the arguable one, so the reasoning is recorded rather than
 * assumed. A host only ever sends methods its own hookmap maps, so a Guardian
 * refusing to dispatch one is a misconfiguration of THIS deployment -- the
 * hookmap and the Guardian disagree about what is governed -- and that is not
 * a permission to proceed. The alternative reading, deliberately rejected:
 * handshake.json's `methods_evaluated` says "Methods listed by the client but
 * absent here are NOT evaluated ... Clients MAY still emit them for audit but
 * MUST treat them as ALLOW-by-default", which would make an undispatched
 * method an allow. That rule is about a method the ServerHello DECLARED it
 * would not evaluate -- negotiated coverage, known before the step -- not
 * about one the Guardian accepted at handshake and then refused at dispatch.
 * A host that read the second as the first would fail open on precisely the
 * disagreement it should surface.
 *
 * Enumerated rather than inferred ("any error object is a refusal"), for the
 * reason TRANSPORT_ERROR_CODES is: the four above are checkable against a
 * live Guardian, and client.test.ts drives each route to prove the list
 * matches what the Guardian actually sends rather than what this file
 * believes. An unrecognised code therefore stays `error_without_decision` and
 * keeps the posture. That is a genuine remaining hole -- a future Guardian
 * code would fail open under `proceed` until it is added here -- and it is
 * preferred to guessing, because widening this to every error object would
 * also fail closed on an intermediary's error the Guardian never sent.
