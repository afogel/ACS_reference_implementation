/**
 * The path language a hookmap is written in, and the one place it is parsed.
 *
 * JSONPath-lite: `$.foo.bar`, `$.foo`, or `$` alone. Only dotted field access
 * -- no array indexing, no filters, no wildcards. Every path a hookmap declares
 * is in this notation (`tool_name`, `arguments`, an `outputs` block's `from` and
 * `within`, and each `from:` under a payload's field map), and this module is
 * how all of them are read.
 *
 * One parser, because the reserved-segment policy is a property of the
 * language rather than of any one caller. A guard that lived in whichever
 * module last remembered it would be a guard the next module did not have
 * -- and the failure it prevents is not a crash. A path ending `__proto__`
 * resolves through inherited lookup, so it satisfies every "is it present?"
 * check both sides make and then reads or writes prototype machinery
 * instead of a field the host produced. On the reading side that silently
 * hands `Object.prototype` to a caller expecting a tool's value.
 *
 * So the segments are refused here, where the notation is defined, and every
 * reader of it gets the refusal whether or not its author thought about it.
 *
 * Parsed once, never re-joined. `resolveSegments` takes already-split
 * segments and nothing re-joins them into a string to look up again. That is
 * a rule rather than a preference: a leaf segment of `$raw` parsed a second
 * time reads as `raw` (a second parse strips the leading `$`), so a version
 * that re-joined and re-split could type-check one field while patching a
 * different one under a different name. Two parses of one path are two
 * paths.
 *
 * This module knows a path notation. Nothing about ACS, hosts, or policy.
