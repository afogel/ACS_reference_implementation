/**
 * A hookmap for a host that is not Claude Code, deliberately: using the real
 * hookmap's decisions block here would make every assertion in this file
 * also an assertion about one host's field names, so the adapter's own
 * tests could not tell "renders what the hookmap says" apart from "renders
 * permissionDecision". This host nests its decision two levels deep under
 * different names, carries a field OUTSIDE that wrapper, and has no
 * permission-style field at all. Nothing in the module under test knows any
 * of it.
 *
 * V4: the `decisions` block lives under the HOOK that asked, so this fixture
 * declares one hook and hangs its decisions off it. `renderDecision` is told
 * which hook it is rendering for, because a host with two gates renders a
 * different shape at each -- and it must not be able to answer one gate with
 * the other's rule.
 *
 * The tests at the bottom do load the real file, so the shipped hookmap is
 * still exercised end to end, at both of its hooks.
