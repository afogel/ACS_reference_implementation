/**

 * construction. On a host where one sibling is a genuine MIRROR of the leaf --
 * its own copy of the same text, not merely a neighbouring field -- that
 * discipline is exactly the property that leaks: the clone preserves the
 * mirror untouched, and the mirror still carries the plaintext.
 *
 * The example paths below (`$.result.output`, `$.result.metadata.output`) are
 * the brief's own stand-in shape, not any real host's field names -- this
 * module names no host field, and neither does this test.
