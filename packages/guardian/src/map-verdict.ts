/**
 * The $policy_target bound survives as ACS modifications.

 * AGT's transform names the leaf it rewrote by the literal "$policy_target",

 * verdict therefore means two different ACS edits depending on which gate
 * asked: at the request gate $policy_target is a tool argument, which ACS
 * expresses as parameter_overrides keyed by argument name; at the result gate
 * it is a leaf of the result payload, which ACS expresses as a redaction
 * addressed by JSON pointer. So the rule is read from `point`'s own row of
 * mapping.yaml's intervention_points table -- the same table
 * resolveInterventionPoint reads -- and the point is a parameter rather than
 * something inferred here.
 *
 * The output key comes from rule.into, not a hardcoded literal, so this
 * stays genuinely declaration-driven: mapping.yaml and this function can
 * never quietly disagree about which modifications.json field the rewrite
 * lands in. rule.into is still checked against the values this mapping
 * can express before use, because loadMapping validates nothing at runtime
 * -- the same reason transform.path is checked against rule.when_path
 * above rather than trusted.
 *
 * Every failure here is a THROW, and the alternative in each case is worse
 * than a reported failure: a point with no rule, a transform of a path the
 * mapping cannot name, or an `into` the code cannot build would all otherwise
 * become a `modify` the host has nothing to apply -- a rewrite reported as
 * applied while the original is delivered. The Guardian's evaluation catch
 * turns these into an honoured `deny` instead (§6.4).
 *
 * Note what is NOT here: re-applying the substitution. `verdict.transform.value`
 * is already the finished string -- AGT's own rule applies the substitution
 * before the verdict is formed, confirmed against the pinned bundle by the
 * SDK also reporting it as `transformedPolicyTarget` beside the verdict -- so
 * this moves a value rather than recomputing one. The bridge does not forward
 * that second field: it is the SDK's evidence for the claim, not the channel
 * the value travels by, and `PolicyBridge.evaluate` answers with the verdict
 * alone.
