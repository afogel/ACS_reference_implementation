/**
 * Public surface of the guardian package: the governance verbs, and nothing
 * else.
 *
 * The envelope log's writer (`./envelope-log-sink.ts`) is deliberately not
 * re-exported. Observability is an internal detail of running a Guardian,
 * not part of the vocabulary a consumer of this package speaks, and a
 * barrel that mixed `startGuardian` / `mapVerdict` with
 * `createEnvelopeLogSink` / `NULL_ENVELOPE_LOG_SINK` / `extractRpcId` / the
 * entry types would make the second look like the first. The one affordance
 * a consumer actually needs is `envelopeLogPath` on `StartGuardianOptions`,
 * which stays exactly where it was: you tell a Guardian where to write its
 * envelope log, you do not assemble the sink yourself.
 *
 * `./server.ts` imports the sink directly, and the two test files that
 * exercise it on its own
 * (`packages/guardian/test/envelope-log-sink*.test.ts`) import
 * `../src/envelope-log-sink.ts` directly too, so nothing outside this
 * package needs it re-exported here. If an external writer of the envelope
 * log ever becomes a real need, the answer is a narrow subpath export, not
 * putting it back in this barrel.
 *
 * The Inspector is unaffected either way: it imports nothing from this
 * package, reads the envelope log purely as a file, and re-declares
 * `EnvelopeLogEntry` on its own side. `test/invariants.test.ts` enforces
 * that boundary, and `test/envelope-log-sink-roundtrip.test.ts` keeps the
 * two declarations honest with each other.
