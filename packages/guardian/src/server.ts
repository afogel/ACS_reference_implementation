/**
 * startGuardian serves the ACS wire boundary: a single JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint,
 * POST /acs. The spec mandates no URL path convention -- "/acs" is this
 * project's own choice -- so dispatch inside the handler is by the JSON-RPC
 * `method` field, never by URL path.
 *
 * Composes the full pipeline, in order, for each ACS method it assembles a
 * snapshot for -- `steps/toolCallRequest` and `steps/toolCallResult`:
 *   validateEnvelope -> resolveInterventionPoint(method, mapping) ->
 *   resolvePolicyTargetArgument(mapping, point, tool.name) ->
 *   assemblePreToolCallSnapshot / assemblePostToolCallSnapshot ->
 *   bridge.evaluate(point, snapshot) ->
 *   mapVerdict(verdict, mapping, point, policyTargetArgument) -> response envelope.
 * The resolved point reaches mapVerdict because the ACS modification an AGT
 * transform becomes differs per gate: a tool argument override at the
 * request gate, a redaction on the result payload at the result gate. The
 * resolved argument reaches both the assembler and mapVerdict for the same
 * reason: it is the argument a policy target is read FROM and the argument an
 * override is written TO, and asking twice would let the two answers differ.
 *
 * Every throw on this path is caught, in two places, because nothing may
 * escape the fetch handler. Bun.serve would answer an unhandled rejection with
 * its default error page, which is HTML rather than JSON-RPC. The host's
 * client calls res.json() unconditionally, so an HTML body raises a
 * SyntaxError there instead of surfacing a JSON-RPC error; the hook's
 * catch-all then exits 1 with nothing on stdout, which Claude Code reads as
 * "the hook never fired" and allows the tool call through ungoverned. That is
 * a fail-open in a governance tool.
 *
 * The two catches are:
 *   - Inside `evaluateStep` (reached from `dispatch`, once per assembling
 *     gate), around the assembler / bridge.evaluate / mapVerdict -- the
 *     evaluation itself.
 *   - Around the whole `dispatch` call in `handleAcsRequest` -- the outer
 *     net. `dispatch` rethrows anything that is not an
 *     EnvelopeValidationError, and that rethrow is live: validateEnvelope
 *     builds its Ajv registry lazily, on the first request rather than at
 *     boot, so a tree cloned without `--recurse-submodules` starts cleanly
 *     and then turns every request into an HTML 500. The outer net puts that
 *     failure response back on the recorded path too, so the envelope log
 *     holds a line for it like any other response.
 *
 * Two distinct catches on the dispatch path -- the evaluation catch above
 * and dispatch's own EnvelopeValidationError catch, around `validateEnvelope`
 * -- turn a steps/* failure into an honoured ACS `deny` decision via
 * denyOnInvalidEnvelope: see the module comment on `dispatch` below. The
 * outer net here is deliberately left untouched: it exists for a `dispatch`
 * rethrow -- a bug in the Guardian itself, such as a missing schema
 * directory, not an invalid envelope -- so it stays a bare JSON-RPC error.
 *
 * The bridge and the mapping table are both built once, when startGuardian is
 * called, rather than per request -- AGT is meant to be constructed at boot
 * and evaluated statelessly.
 *
 * The listening socket defaults to loopback (127.0.0.1). Bun.serve with no
 * `hostname` binds `*` -- every interface, dual-stack -- and this endpoint has
 * no authentication, no origin check and no request signing, so anything that
 * can open the port is both a policy oracle (ask it what would be allowed)
 * and a policy sink (feed it envelopes it evaluates as if a governed host had
 * sent them). Until the wire is authenticated, reachability IS the access
 * control, so the default is the narrowest bind a host shim on the same
 * machine can still reach. A deployment that genuinely needs a routable bind
 * -- a Guardian in its own container, say -- opts in explicitly through the
 * `hostname` option (main.ts reads ACS_GUARDIAN_HOST for it).

 * Both catches in this module -- the outer net in handleAcsRequest and the

 * (an ENOENT out of a missing schema directory, say) carries this machine's
 * absolute filesystem path, e.g.
 * `/Users/you/.../ACS_reference_implementation/packages/spec/acs/...`.
 * That is diagnostic in a way this demo's value depends on, so rather than
 * replace it with something generic, this function removes only the part
 * that discloses where this tree sits on disk, leaving the repo-relative
 * remainder (`packages/spec/acs/...`) intact.
 *
 * Takes the caught value itself, as `unknown`, rather than a pre-extracted
 * string, and calls `String()` on the whole thing. `instanceof Error` does
 * not guarantee `.message` is a string -- nothing stops it from being
 * reassigned to `undefined`, a number, or anything else after construction
 * -- and a throw from this function on the outer-net path has nothing above
 * `handleAcsRequest` to catch it. Staying total for any `unknown`, exactly
 * what a catch clause can hand it, is what keeps that path from becoming an
 * unrecorded HTML 500.
 *
 * Exported -- unlike this module's other internals (`dispatch`, `extractId`,
 * `extractMethod`, `errorResponse`) -- so the redaction above and this

 * also covered end to end, separately -- see server.test.ts's
 * `withFakeValidateEnvelopeGuardian` tests.
 *
 * The whole body is wrapped in its own try/catch, including the
 * `instanceof` check -- belt-and-braces, not a reaction to a live bug.
 * Nothing in this tree currently throws an `Error` whose `.message` is a
 * throwing accessor, a value whose `toString`/`valueOf` throws, or a
 * `Proxy` that throws on `get` or on `getPrototypeOf` (which would defeat
 * `instanceof Error` itself, since it walks the prototype chain through
 * `[[GetPrototypeOf]]`, before `String()` below ever runs). They are guarded
 * anyway because "unreachable today" should not be load-bearing for the one
 * function whose entire job is upholding this module's contract that

 * measured, so measuring afterwards enforces nothing. Reading chunk by chunk
 * and holding nothing past the cap is what makes the limit a limit.
 *
 * What the cap bounds is what this process HOLDS, not what a client may
 * transmit -- and that distinction is forced, not chosen. The body is drained
 * to its end even once it is refused, because leaving it unread (whether by
 * cancelling the stream or by returning before touching it) leaves the

 * keep-alive connection with an empty 400, which a host reads as a delivery
 * failure and resolves with its posture. Refusing one oversize body by
 * breaking the next legitimate request would be a wider fail-open than the
 * one this cap closes. So memory is bounded here, and total transfer stays
 * bounded by the runtime's own per-request ceiling above this.
 *
 * Which check is authoritative, since there are two: the count of bytes
 * actually read. `Content-Length` is a claim -- a chunked body declares none,
 * and a client may declare one length and send another -- so it can refuse a
 * body before anything is held, but it can never admit one. `detail` says
 * which of the two refused, because "you declared 4 MiB" and "you sent 4 MiB
 * having declared nothing" are different client bugs and an operator reading

 * request gate, and a second copy of it is a second thing to keep true.
 *
 * Generic in the envelope, and the assembler is a function OF that envelope --
 * `E` and `(envelope: E, sourceLabels: IfcLabels, policyTargetArgument: string
 * | undefined) => GuardianSnapshot` rather than an `AcsRequestEnvelope` and an
 * independent thunk. `E` infers from the narrowed variable each gate passes,
 * both assemblers are assignable as they stand (`assemblePostToolCallSnapshot`
 * takes two parameters and a two-parameter function is assignable to a
 * three-parameter function type), and the one miswiring this function could
 * otherwise permit becomes unrepresentable: `evaluateStep(raw, envelopeA, (_e, s, p) => assemblePreToolCallSnapshot(envelopeB, s, p), ...)`
 * would have resolved the point from A's method and echoed A's ids while
 * evaluating B's snapshot -- the wrong policy against the wrong shape, which
 * this file's own comments call worse than a reported failure. In the inline
 * form that gap did not exist, because the narrowed variable was structurally
 * the one variable; the tie has to be re-stated in the signature once the tail
 * is shared, not left to the call sites to get right.
 *
 * The generic keeps each assembler's parameter type narrow while this function
 * stays method-agnostic about the SNAPSHOT: nothing here reads a snapshot
 * member, so nothing here needs to know which shape it got, and no union of
 * the two snapshot types is needed to say so -- `GuardianSnapshot` is the
 * union of the two messages this Guardian can send, and this function reads
 * no member of either. It does read envelope members now, for the chain
 * entry: `params.metadata.session_id` and `params.request_id`, both already
 * generic over plain `AcsRequestEnvelope` (method-independent, so no
 * narrower bound was needed for them), and one PAYLOAD member,
 * `payload.tool.name` -- the one member `SteppedEnvelope` above exists for,
 * since `payload` is generically `Record<string, unknown>` otherwise. All
 * three reads are shared identically by both payload shapes, so none
 * carries the wrong-shape risk the paragraph above is about. The assembler
 * is called INSIDE the try, so a throw from it -- or from appending to the
 * chain, or from persisting labels -- lands in the same catch as a throw
 * from AGT.
 *
 * The intervention point comes from mapping.yaml's own `intervention_points`
 * table, not from a literal here: that table is what the conformance
 * package's mapping table publishes -- never its coverage matrix, which
 * measures rather than declares -- and a declaration the runtime does not
 * consult is a claim nobody checks. An unresolvable method throws into the
 * catch below rather than defaulting to a point -- evaluating the wrong policy
 * and calling the result a decision is the one outcome worse than a reported
 * failure.
