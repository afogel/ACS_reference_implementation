/**
 * The Guardian's per-session state, and the hash chain that orders it.
 *
 * This module declares three types and one aggregate over them.
 * `SessionContext` holds a session's hash chain alone -- its entries and the
 * digests that link them. `Intent` holds the immutable first-message
 * baseline recorded for a session, and `SessionProvenance` holds the record
 * described below, including AGT's IFC labels. `SessionState` is what the
 * store holds for one session: the three together, with the chain held as
 * the array the store appends to rather than as a `SessionContext`, because
 * the store pushes onto that array and a reader must not be handed
 * something that grows underneath it. Keeping `SessionContext` scoped to
 * just the chain matters because `loadSessionContext` returns exactly that
 * type, and its name should promise no more than what it returns.
 *
 * This is declared in the Guardian's own package, not in `@acs/host-adapter`:
 * the adapter is what a host links against, and a host neither writes this
 * chain nor is trusted to write it. `@acs/host-adapter` already exports a
 * `Session*` cluster -- `SessionConfig`, `SessionConfigStore`,
 * `ResolvedSessionConfig` and friends -- and every one of them is about the
 * handshake. `SessionContext` is a different object with a different owner,
 * so it is never shortened to `session`, and the two names always appear
 * written out in full.
 *
 * This chain's `seq` does not inherit the audit log's duplicate-`seq`
 * hazard, and the reason is structural. The audit log's `seq` is derived by
 * a fresh host subprocess re-reading the log on each hook, so two concurrent
 * hooks can derive the same number. `seq` here is assigned by the store that
 * owns the chain, inside the Guardian's single `Bun.serve` process, and the
 * entries' order is carried by `prev_hash` rather than by the counter: two
 * entries claiming the same `seq` would still have to agree on a hash
 * covering the entry before them. `seq` is an index for readers, not the
 * chain's integrity.

 * AGT's IFC tags: the type of the `ifc_labels` field below, and nothing wider.
 *
 * This Guardian has no separate store for labels. They are a field on a
 * session's provenance record, held alongside that session's chain and
 * intent by the one thing here called a store, `SessionContextStore`.
 *
 * ACS `Provenance` (`spec/acs/specification/v0.1.0/provenance.json`, which
 * defines `provenance_id`, `origin`, `source_id`, `derived_from`) carries no
 * label member. This does not widen it into a label bag; the labels ride a
 * named field on the record below.
