/**
 * Two assemblers, one per gate, each converting a validated ACS request
 * envelope into the AGT snapshot for the intervention point that answers its
 * method, shaped per AGT-SNAPSHOT-1.0.md §2.5:
 *
 *   assemblePreToolCallSnapshot   steps/toolCallRequest -> pre_tool_call
 *   assemblePostToolCallSnapshot  steps/toolCallResult  -> post_tool_call
 *
 * Siblings, not one function with two modes. §2.5 gives each point its own
 * snapshot shape, and these two share no member but `envelope.budgets`: one
 * carries the arguments a step was asked to run, the other the outputs it
 * produced. A single assembler reading `payload.arguments` OR `payload.outputs`
 * depending on what it found would be back to the union type the narrowing
 * exists to prevent, and would accept an envelope of either method when each
 * snapshot shape belongs to only one.
 *
 * `assemblePreToolCallSnapshot` keeps its original name rather than being
 * renamed to match its sibling: its parameter type already says which
 * envelope it takes, and `assemblePostToolCallSnapshot` names the wire's noun
 * for the other one.
 *
 * Envelope-only: both read nothing but the envelope handed to them -- no
 * session state, no chain hash, no prior decisions, no intent. The result
 * gate carries no `tool_call.args` for the same reason and one more: the
 * result payload has none to carry, and synthesizing them from the
 * originating request would be inventing state this module does not have.

/**
 * The AGT `post_tool_call` snapshot, standing beside `AgtPreToolCallSnapshot`
 * rather than widening it with optional members. Named for its own
 * intervention point, for the same reason its twin is.
 *
 * Every member is load-bearing, and there are only three:
 *   - `envelope.budgets`     the one member both snapshots carry.
 *   - `tool_call.name`       synthesized from the result payload's
 *                            `tool.name`. ACS's result payload has no
 *                            `tool_call` member of its own, and AGT resolves
 *                            the manifest's `tool_name_from` before any
 *                            policy runs -- a snapshot without a name fails
 *                            closed with `runtime_error:path_missing` on
 *                            every call (test/redaction.test.ts pins it).
 *   - `tool_result.outputs`  what policy/manifest.yaml's post_tool_call point
 *                            targets, at `$.tool_result.outputs[0].value`.
 *                            Every output is carried, and that target names
 *                            index 0 -- so a step returning several outputs
 *                            has its first one evaluated and the rest
 *                            carried but unexamined. That is the manifest's
 *                            declaration, not this assembler's choice;
 *                            widening it is a manifest change with its own
 *                            policy consequences.
 *
 * Three members absent on purpose, each for its own reason:
 *   - `tool_call.args`  the result payload has none. Carrying the
 *                       originating call's arguments forward would be
 *                       inventing state this module does not have.
 *   - `tool_call.id`    not because no id is on the wire -- `params.request_id`
 *                       is required by request-envelope.json at every step,
 *                       and the request gate uses exactly that field for its
 *                       own `tool_call.id`. But at this step that field
 *                       identifies this result message, not the call that
 *                       produced it. The originating call's id arrives only
 *                       as the optional `request_id_ref`, so an id here
 *                       would name the wrong request, and nothing here
 *                       correlates the two.
 *   - `exit_status`     required by hooks/tool-call-result.json, validated
 *                       on the way in, and deliberately not forwarded: AGT's
 *                       snapshot for this point (test/redaction.test.ts pins
 *                       the shape the stock bundle evaluates) has no place
 *                       for it, and no stock rule reads it.
 *
 * `outputs` items are `{value}` alone -- ACS's `{value, provenance}` wrapper does
 * not survive into a snapshot, the same rule the request side applies to its
 * arguments, and `value` stays `unknown` because what a tool produced is the
 * tool's business rather than this project's.
