/**
 * This module is validateEnvelope's outbound counterpart. It closes a gap:
 * inbound requests are compiled against three schemas (request-envelope.json
 * and, method-gated, the two hook payload schemas -- all 44 are registered so
 * `$ref`s resolve, but only those three are ever compiled) and responses
 * were hand-built objects checked by nothing. A conformance harness
 * publishing a matrix over that wire would have been measuring a format
 * that was never itself contract-checked -- which weakens exactly the claim
 * the coverage matrix exists to prove: that ACS v0.1.0's expressiveness
 * against AGT is checked case by case, not merely asserted.
 *
 * THREE STATUSES, AND EACH NAMES A DIFFERENT FACT. They are a status, not
 * values of a boolean called `valid`, because one of them is not an answer
 * about validity at all:
 *
 *   checked_valid     compiled against the schema, and satisfied it.
 *   checked_invalid   compiled against the schema, and did not.
 *   unchecked         the schema registry could not be built, so no
 *                     comparison happened.
 *
 * The last was previously folded into `valid: false`, which said the
 * response had been checked and rejected. "Never checked" and "checked and
 * rejected" are different facts about a response the Guardian is about to
 * send, and a deployment reading the first as the second would be chasing a
 * schema violation that was never observed.
 *
 * Every response the Guardian sends is checked here, the handshake
 * included. Before spec release v0.1.2, `response-envelope.json` declared
 * `result` as an unconditional `$ref` to `AcsResult`, which requires
 * `decision`; a ServerHello has none, so a correct handshake response could
 * not satisfy the envelope and this module carried a fourth status,
 * `unexpressible`, to say so without calling it invalid. v0.1.2 made
 * `result` a `oneOf` over `AcsResult` and handshake.json's `ServerHello`,
 * so the handshake response is now compiled against the schema like any
 * other, and a malformed ServerHello is reported at a pointer rather than
 * passing under a bypass. The check result is not written into the
 * envelope log (`envelope-log-sink.ts`); carrying it onto that wire so the
 * Inspector could render it is future work this module does not attempt.
 *
 * REPORTS, NEVER THROWS, and never alters the response -- which is why the
 * verb is `check` rather than `validate`. Inbound, `validateEnvelope`
 * throws and the request stops. This runs on the decision path, after the
 * decision is made; a check that could turn a governed tool call into an
 * error response would be a fail-open of exactly the family this project
 * keeps closing. A response that fails is still sent, and the failure is
 * recorded. `ResponseCheck` is the twin of the conformance harness's
 * `SchemaLegResult`, which reports `{ran: false, reason}` for the same
 * reason: whether a check ran is a fact it has to be able to state.
 *
 * The Ajv instance is validate-envelope.ts's own, reached through its
 * exported `getValidator(schemaId)` rather than rebuilt here: both modules
 * load the same 44 schemas from the same SCHEMA_ROOT, so building a second
 * registry would mean two loads of the same files and two places a future
 * edit to the loading logic would have to land in step. Sharing the lookup
 * function makes that agreement structural rather than a convention two
 * files happen to follow.
 *
 * `getValidator` itself is not total -- it throws when the schema registry
 * cannot be built at all (a tree cloned without `--recurse-submodules`,
 * server.ts's own header names this exact case for the inbound side), and
 * `test/server.test.ts`'s `withSchemalessGuardian` reproduces it for real:
 * relocating a copy of this package one directory deeper makes SCHEMA_ROOT
 * resolve to a path that does not exist, and `readdirSync` throws ENOENT.
 * On the inbound side that throw is caught by `dispatch` and turned into a
 * parseable JSON-RPC error; this function is called AFTER that recovery,
 * immediately before the response is sent, with nothing above it in
 * server.ts to catch a second throw -- so if this function let one escape,
 * the exact fail-open server.ts's header exists to prevent would reopen one
 * call later, on the way out instead of the way in. `unchecked` is what
 * makes "reports, never throws" true for a broken deployment and not only
 * for a well-formed one.
