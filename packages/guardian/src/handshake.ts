/**
 * buildServerHello builds the Guardian's answer to `handshake/hello`, per
 * handshake.json's ServerHello $def
 * (spec/acs/specification/v0.1.0/handshake.json).
 *
 * `build`, not `negotiate`: this function never reads the incoming
 * ClientHello. The client (host-adapter's `negotiateSessionConfig`) genuinely
 * sends one, but every field below is a constant, returned unconditionally.
 * So `negotiated_version` and `selected_transport` are declared by this
 * Guardian rather than agreed against what the client proposed. Real
 * negotiation -- reading the ClientHello, picking a mutually supported
 * version and transport, rejecting what isn't -- is future work; see the
 * matching note in docs/demos/v1-runbook.md.
 *
 * `methods_evaluated` is exactly the set this Guardian actually dispatches,
 * pinned against the dispatch by
 * test/handshake-declares-what-it-evaluates.test.ts rather than by this
 * sentence. See METHODS_EVALUATED below for why it is checked and not
 * derived.
 *
 * `on_decision_failure` ships the spec default, "proceed" (fail-open). This
 * responder's posture is deployment-configurable, so one binary can
 * demonstrate both fail-open and fail-closed behaviour without a rebuild.
 * This function only declares the posture on the wire; applying it happens
 * in host-adapter. A value that is neither posture throws rather than
 * falling back -- guessing which posture a typo meant would be a silent
 * bypass.

 * The methods this Guardian actually dispatches -- exactly the two gated
 * branches in server.ts (`isToolCallRequest` -> `assembleSnapshot`,
 * `isToolCallResult` -> `assembleResultSnapshot`). Anything else falls to
 * `method_not_dispatched`.
 *
 * This list has to agree exactly with what server.ts dispatches, in both
 * directions, and handshake.json's text for this field is not advisory:
 * "Methods listed by the client but absent here are NOT evaluated; the
 * Guardian's enforcement does not cover them. Clients MAY still emit them
 * for audit but MUST treat them as ALLOW-by-default." Naming a method here
 * that no branch dispatches claims enforcement that does not exist, which a
 * host is entitled to rely on. Omitting a method the dispatch does handle is
 * just as dangerous the other way: a conformant host would read this
 * ServerHello and treat that gate's decisions as advisory, ignoring them by
 * default, while the Guardian is actually enforcing them.
 *
 * So the relationship is checked rather than trusted --
 * test/handshake-declares-what-it-evaluates.test.ts drives a candidate
 * envelope for every method mapping.yaml maps through a live Guardian and
 * asserts that the set it does not answer `method_not_dispatched` for is
 * exactly this list.
 *
 * It stays a literal on purpose. The dispatch it must agree with is two
 * predicate-gated branches, deliberately not a table (server.ts says why: a
 * point-driven dispatch would hand one method's envelope to another method's
 * assembler and return a well-formed verdict for the wrong policy). Nothing
 * in this module can read "what server.ts branches on", so deriving this
 * list from, say, validate-envelope's method constants would only pin that a
 * predicate exists, not that dispatch actually reaches it. The test verifies
 * what the code cannot.
