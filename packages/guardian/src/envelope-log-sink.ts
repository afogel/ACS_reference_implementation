/**
 * createEnvelopeLogSink writes a JSONL record of every ACS envelope that
 * crosses this Guardian's wire, in both directions. The Envelope Inspector
 * reads this file and nothing else -- see packages/inspector, which
 * deliberately imports nothing from here.
 *
 * Named for the artifact it produces and the role it plays, not for the
 * mechanism: it writes a log, it does not "tap a wire".
 *
 * What "records the envelope" means here, precisely: the sink is handed the
 * JSON *value* the Guardian parsed, and writes it unmodified -- no field
 * stripping, no redaction, no reordering of anything we control. It is not a
 * byte-for-byte copy of the request body. The parse happens upstream in
 * server.ts (`await req.json()`) and has already collapsed duplicate keys,
 * canonicalised number literals, and hoisted integer-like object keys -- and
 * `arguments` keys are host-controlled, so `{"0": ...}` is a real shape, not
 * a hypothetical. Recording raw bytes instead would make `envelope` a string
 * rather than a JSON value, costing the Inspector its pretty-printing and
 * the round-trip contract test; the accurate sentence is the better trade.
 *
 * Total by construction. Every write is wrapped: a failure disables the sink
 * for the process lifetime, reports once, and is never propagated to the
 * caller. The sink sits on the decision path: an observability feature that
 * can turn a governed tool call into an ungoverned one is the one failure
 * mode this module must never have. Observability degrades; governance does
 * not.
