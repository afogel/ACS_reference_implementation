/**
 * tailEnvelopeLog (N50) streams S6 -- the Guardian's JSONL envelope log --
 * as it grows, the way `tail -f` does.
 *
 * This package deliberately imports nothing from `guardian` or from any of
 * its dependencies (global constraint 10). The Inspector reads a file that
 * the Guardian happens to write; it holds no compile-time knowledge of the
 * process that produced it, which is the point of R5.1 -- envelopes are
 * inspectable *on the wire*, not through our own type graph. EnvelopeLogEntry
 * is therefore re-declared here rather than imported. The round-trip test at
 * test/envelope-log-sink-roundtrip.test.ts is what keeps the two declarations in
 * agreement; if they drift, it fails.
 *
 * The names are the artifact's, not the writer's (PR #11 review). This
 * package's public surface used to carry `TapEntry` / `TapDirection` --
 * the Guardian's nickname for its own writing mechanism, on a module whose
 * whole job is reading -- and a bare `TailOptions` that named no log at all.
 * A later slice gives this package a second stream to follow, and the two
 * only read as siblings if each names its own log: `EnvelopeLogEntry` beside
 * that stream's entry type, `TailEnvelopeLogOptions` beside its options type,
 * the way `tailEnvelopeLog` and its twin verb already do.
 *
 * Polling rather than fs.watch: appends to a growing file are exactly the
 * case where watch semantics differ most across platforms, and a 120ms poll
 * on a local demo log costs nothing.
 *
 * The poll runs on its own timer once started, independent of whether
 * anything is actively pulling values from the returned generator. That
 * independence is load-bearing, not incidental: a consumer can read one
 * entry and then pause before asking for the next one, and the file can be
 * truncated and rewritten entirely within that pause. A poll folded into
 * the generator's own suspend/resume points only ever inspects the file at
 * the instant the consumer resumes it -- by then a truncate-and-rewrite can
 * look exactly like ordinary growth (a same-length-or-longer rewrite makes
 * the new size come out >= the old offset, so a size-only check never
 * fires). A timer that keeps ticking regardless of consumption catches the
 * file while it is still sitting at zero.
 *
 * The timer itself, though, only starts on the first `next()` -- inside the
 * returned generator's body, not inside this function. A caller that builds
 * a tail and never iterates it (and never aborts) should not leave a timer
 * running forever; tying its start to first consumption means an unused
 * tail costs nothing.
 *
 * The starting offset is a separate concern from the timer, and is captured
 * synchronously right here, when this function is called -- not lazily
 * inside the generator body, which would not run at all until the caller's
 * first `next()`. "Start at the current end" has to mean the moment
 * `tailEnvelopeLog` was called, not the moment someone first asked it for a
 * value; the truncation scenario above still works even though the timer
 * itself starts later, because by the time a consumer has read anything at
 * all, `next()` has already been called once and the timer is already
 * running.
 *
 * `poll()` runs as a bare timer callback with nothing awaiting it, so
 * nothing is in a position to catch a thrown error the way a rejected
 * promise would be caught by a consumer's `for await`. A file that
 * disappears between the size check and the read -- rotation schemes that
 * unlink-and-recreate rather than truncate-in-place can do this -- must
 * therefore be handled inside `poll()` itself; letting it throw out of a
 * timer callback would crash the whole process instead of merely losing a
 * line.
