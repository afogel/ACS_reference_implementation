/**
 * tailSessionContextLog (U22's reader) streams S3 -- the Guardian's
 * per-session hash chain, appended one JSONL line per entry by
 * packages/guardian/src/session-context-store.ts -- as it grows, the way
 * `tail -f` does.
 *
 * Same contract as tailAuditLog: same option shape, same lazily-started
 * poll, same eagerly-captured starting offset, same Buffer-based
 * partial-line reassembly, same shape check between `JSON.parse` and
 * `yield`, same report-once discipline for a poll that fails and for a log
 * that goes missing after having existed. That design is not re-derived
 * here; see tail-audit-log.ts's module doc for the reasoning behind each of
 * those choices, all of which apply unchanged to this file.
 *
 * S3, like S14, is created lazily by its writer on the first entry appended:
 * packages/guardian/src/server.ts's session-context-log appender calls
 * `appendFileSync`, which creates the file on its first call. A session that
 * never appends an entry never creates this file at all, and that must stay
 * silent rather than reported as a missing log -- the same healthy-absence
 * case tail-audit-log.ts's module doc describes for S14.
 *
 * This package imports nothing from `guardian` (R5.1). SessionContextLogEntry
 * is re-declared here rather than imported; the round-trip contract test at
 * test/session-context-roundtrip.test.ts is what keeps the two declarations
 * in agreement.
 *
 * ONE FILE, MANY SESSIONS. The Guardian appends every session's entries to
 * this one log, in whatever order its own single process happens to append
 * them. `seq` is per session (packages/guardian/src/session-context.ts), so
 * a file's lines are not globally ordered by it. This reader makes no
 * attempt to sort or group entries by session; it yields each line in the
 * order it appears in the file, carrying its own `session_id`, and leaves
 * grouping to whatever reads the stream. `renderSessionChain` (render.ts) is
 * the reader that groups: a chain-break check comparing an entry only to the
 * line immediately before it, with no regard for which session either one
 * belongs to, would report a break every time two different sessions'
 * entries happened to interleave.
