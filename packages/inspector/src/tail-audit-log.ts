/**
 * tailAuditLog (N51) streams S14 -- the audit record §6.4 requires for every
 * step that proceeds with no decision behind it -- as it grows, the way
 * `tail -f` does. Same contract as tailEnvelopeLog: same option shape, same
 * lazily-started poll, same eagerly-captured starting offset, same
 * Buffer-based partial-line reassembly, same shape check between
 * `JSON.parse` and `yield`. That design is not re-derived here; see
 * tail-envelope-log.ts's module doc for the reasoning behind each of those
 * choices, all of which apply unchanged to this file.
 *
 * S14 is written on the other side of the wire from S6: something that
 * negotiates a failure posture, not anything running a policy decision.
 * This package still imports nothing from it. AuditEntry is re-declared
 * here for the same reason TapEntry is: the round-trip contract test at
 * test/audit-sink-roundtrip.test.ts is what keeps the two declarations in
 * agreement, and importing the other side's type would make that agreement
 * a tautology instead of a check.
 *
 * One divergence from tail-envelope-log.ts, deliberate rather than
 * incidental: there, a log file that does not exist yet is ordinary --
 * nothing has written to it, and `sizeOf` reports that as size zero with no
 * complaint. Here, a log that *existed and then went missing* is reported
 * through `onPollError` instead of silently read as size zero -- but a log
 * that has never yet appeared is still treated as size zero without
 * comment, exactly like tail-envelope-log.ts. That distinction matters
 * because a session with zero fail-open bypasses never creates S14 at all
 * (the sink on the other side of the wire creates its file lazily, on its
 * first write) -- that is the *healthy* outcome, and it must not read as an
 * error repeated on every tick for as long as the Inspector runs. A log
 * that vanishes after this tailer had already read from it is a different,
 * genuinely reportable event -- but reported once, on the tick the absence
 * is first observed, not on every tick it remains absent: a human watching
 * this stream needs to be told the log went away, not shown the same line
 * once a poll interval forever.
 *
 * Because the poll after recreation must not assume whatever is on disk now
 * continues what was read before -- an unlink-and-recreate can land a
 * same-length replacement at the very offset already consumed, which a
 * size-only comparison would then read as no growth at all -- the offset is
 * still reset once, on the tick the file is seen to exist again, whether or
 * not its absence was ever reported.
