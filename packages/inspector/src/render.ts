/**
 * This module renders four things: the envelope stream, the decision badge,
 * the posture badge, and the audit-entry line.
 *
 * EVERY RENDERER HERE IS PURE, and one function is not a renderer. No clock,
 * no env, no process anywhere in this file; the CLI decides whether the
 * terminal wants ANSI and passes `color`; tests assert exact plain strings.
 * The exception is named rather than absorbed: `checkSessionChainLink` records
 * each entry's `hash` into the `SessionChainState` its caller owns, because a
 * chain check is a fold over a stream and has to remember what it last saw. It
 * is split OUT of `renderSessionChainRow` for exactly that reason (PR #15
 * review) -- while the two were one function, rendering a row was a write, and
 * rendering the same row twice reported a chain break the second time.
 *
 * Nothing here knows what produced a decision -- the decision
 * badge reads ACS's own `decision`, `reason_codes`, and `policy_references`
 * fields and nothing else. The posture badge and the audit-entry line read
 * only the fields the audit log's AuditEntry declares.
 *
 * `renderDecisionBadge` is told a decision rather than handed a log row to
 * interrogate: `outcomeMessageOf` is the one place that reads an envelope's
 * shape, translating a log line into the small message the renderers need,
 * so a caller can build and render that message without owning an envelope
 * log at all.
 *
 * A decision and an error are two outcomes, not two decisions: a
 * schema-invalid envelope comes back as a JSON-RPC error, which is
 * deliberately not the same thing as an ACS `deny`. `OutcomeMessage` is a
 * discriminated union over the two, with its own renderer per arm --
 * `renderDecisionBadge` for a decision, `renderRpcError` for a response that
 * carried none -- and `renderOutcome` dispatches between them for the
 * stream renderer.

 * `renderSessionChain` calls it once per entry, in array order, against state
 * it owns for the duration of that one call; `main.ts`'s live view calls it
 * once per entry as it is tailed, against state it keeps for the life of the
 * process -- so the two never compute "is this link broken" two different
 * ways.
 *
 * SEPARATE FROM THE RENDERER because it RECORDS as well as answers: it writes
 * this entry's `hash` into `state` as the one the next entry for this session
 * must link to. Fused into `renderSessionChainRow`, that made rendering a
 * mutation -- and rendering the same entry twice reported a chain break on the
 * second call, because by then `state` held that entry's own `hash` and its
 * `prev_hash` no longer matched.
 *
 * A link is broken when the entry's `prev_hash` does not match the `hash` of
 * the entry seen immediately before it FOR THE SAME `session_id` -- read out
 * of `state`, not out of whatever entry came immediately before this one in
 * some caller's array, because that entry can belong to a different session
 * entirely (see tail-session-context.ts's module doc, "ONE FILE, MANY
 * SESSIONS"). An entry that is the first one this `state` has seen for its
 * session is never broken: there is nothing recorded yet to compare its
 * `prev_hash` against.
 *
 * The whole reason this view exists is that the chain is checkable, not
 * merely printable -- a row that read as unbroken regardless of whether it
 * actually linked to its predecessor would be evidence that looks like
 * evidence and is not.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CHECK IS NOT, said here because this is the slice's only integrity
 * affordance and a reader is entitled to know its edge. It compares LINKS --
 * this entry's `prev_hash` against the last `hash` seen for the session -- and
 * never recomputes `hashEntry` over the entry in front of it, so an entry's
 * contents are never checked against its own digest. Three edits therefore
 * read as unbroken, each one measured against this function: a self-consistent
 * rewrite (change a step field and leave `hash`/`prev_hash` alone -- the stored
 * digest stops matching the entry, and nothing recomputes it), a trailing
 * truncation (every surviving link still matches), and a deleted FIRST entry
 * (the next entry becomes the first this `state` has seen, and a first entry is
 * never marked, because nothing here requires it to carry `GENESIS_HASH` or
 * `seq` 1 -- the gap is visible in the printed `seq` but is not flagged). What
 * IS caught is a link that stopped matching: a clobbered `prev_hash`, or a
 * dropped MIDDLE entry, both measured. So this detects corruption and edits
 * that do not bother to re-link; it does not detect an adversary with write
 * access to the log.
