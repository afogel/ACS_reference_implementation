/**
 * AGT verdict -> ACS decision -> AGT verdict, at every intervention point,
 * asserting the verdict that comes back is the one that went in.
 *
 * The forward leg is `mapVerdict`, the runtime's own -- so this measures what
 * the Guardian does rather than what mapping.yaml says it should. The reverse
 * leg is derived from the same declaration by `invertVerdicts` below, and
 * that is the part worth stating: an inverse written by hand here would agree
 * with mapping.yaml because the same hand wrote both, and would go on
 * agreeing after mapping.yaml changed. A round trip through two independent
 * spellings of one table is not a round trip.
 *
 * The mapping is not injective. `allow` and `warn` both become ACS `allow`,
 * discriminated by whether `policy_references` is non-empty: `warn` is allow
 * with a non-empty one. But mapVerdict synthesizes policy_references from
 * verdict.reason for any decision that carries one (map-verdict.ts,
 * unconditionally) -- not only where require_policy_references is declared.
 * A real, reason-carrying `deny` or `escalate` (policy/lib/agt_default.rego
 * synthesizes a `pattern_reason`, defaulting to "pattern_blocked", for deny)
 * therefore produces non-empty policy_references too, and that emptiness
 * means nothing there: deny and escalate are each the only AGT verdict on
 * their ACS decision, so nothing needs discriminating from anything else.
 * The inverse keys emptiness only where mapping.yaml sends more than one AGT
 * verdict to the same ACS decision -- `allow`'s group today -- and keys
 * every other decision by itself.
 *
 * `defer` has no AGT verdict behind it at all and therefore never appears
 * here: this walks AGT's five, not ACS's.
 *
 * WHAT A FAILED ROUND TRIP RESOLVES TO. `contract_violated`, not
 * `unexpressed`: a verdict that goes in and does not come back is this tree's
 * declaration being wrong about itself, and it is the one thing here that
 * fails `bun run conformance` (exit-code.ts's rule, and `cells.ts`'s
 * `CellStatus` for the distinction). `unexpressed` is kept for the answers
 * that are about ACS -- a point ACS v0.1.0 carries no method for, a transform
 * this table declares it has no target for -- because failing on those would
 * make an honest gap indistinguishable from a defect and press the matrix
 * towards being all-expressed.
