 * Three renderers, one per measurement, and none of them takes a

 *
 *   renderMappingTable   (N48 -> U32)  S10's declaration
 *   renderCoverageMatrix (N47 -> U30)  the 8 × 5 N41-N44 measure
 *   renderTraceRows      (N52 -> U33)  N49's attribute-against-wire-source rows
 *
 * A coverage cell is an intervention point against an AGT verdict; a trace
 * row is a required OTel attribute against its wire source; they share a verb
 * and nothing else. Detail C once wired a single `renderMatrix()` to all
 * three, which is the name that would have let the second and third arrive as
 * columns of the first -- and a coverage claim rendered by the same function
 * as everything beside it is a coverage claim whose subject is whatever was
 * rendered. `renderUpstreamDiff` is not here and is not V7's: its only input
 * is V8's `diffSurfaces()`.
 *
 * EVERY FUNCTION HERE IS PURE. Each is handed its measurement and renders
 * that one; none reads a file, a clock or a store. V6's own review found a
 * renderer that had quietly become a write, under a header claiming exactly
 * this -- so the property is asserted, not only stated: each renderer's test
 * renders the same input twice and expects the same string.

 *
 * `cells`' own `point`/`verdict` values are what the grid's rows and columns
 * are drawn from -- not a second, separately imported copy of AGT's
 * vocabulary. That is what keeps this file's only imports type-only (module
 * header, "EVERY FUNCTION HERE IS PURE"): `CoverageCell` and `CellStatus`
 * are erased at build, so nothing this function does can read a file, a
 * clock or a store. `cells` is expected to be `mergeCells`'s own output (one
 * entry per `everyCell()` coordinate); a coordinate the grid names but
 * `cells` does not carry is a caller error, thrown rather than rendered
 * blank -- and a coordinate `cells` carries TWICE is the same caller error
 * the other way round, thrown rather than letting whichever cell sorts last
 * silently win. That second case is what catches the natural misuse this
 * function cannot tell apart from correct input by shape alone:
 * `renderCoverageMatrix([...n41Cells, ...n42Cells])` in place of
 * `renderCoverageMatrix(mergeCells(n41Cells, n42Cells))` -- both are a
 * `CoverageCell[]`, but the first is four checks' raw output concatenated,
 * never merged, and would publish whichever check happened to come last at
 * each coordinate. If that check said `expressed`, the printed matrix would
 * be greener than anything actually measured, silently.
 *
 * THE SUBJECT THIS RENDERS (Task 7 facts, section 2 -- a controller ruling,
 * not a choice made here): a cell is a claim about ACS v0.1.0's expressive
 * power against AGT's vocabulary, not a claim about which methods THIS
 * Guardian evaluates. Those are different questions -- N44 resolves cells
 * `expressed` at four points on the strength of a fail-closed
 * envelope-validation deny, at methods `packages/guardian/src/handshake.ts`'s
 * `METHODS_EVALUATED` never dispatches. So the printed table states its own
 * subject, above the grid, in words a reader does not have to already know
 * that fact to get right.
 *
 * No cell renders blank: every status has a symbol, and no reason is
 * truncated into a cell -- each DISTINCT reason gets one numbered footnote,
 * printed once beneath the grid, and every cell carrying it points at that
 * number.
