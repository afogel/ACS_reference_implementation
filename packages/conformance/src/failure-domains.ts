/**
 * The last of the four checks that feed the coverage-matrix merge, and the
 * only one that drives a live Guardian over HTTP rather than calling
 * `mapVerdict` or `resolveInterventionPoint` in-process -- a check that
 * constructed its own failure in-process would be measuring its own
 * construction, not the wire boundary that keeps the two failure domains
 * below apart.
 *
 * TWO FAILURE DOMAINS, kept apart here exactly as `deny-on-invalid-envelope.ts`
 * keeps them apart at the point that answers them:
 *
 *   (1) AGT'S EVALUATION LAYER FAILS CLOSED (§6.4). An envelope that fails
 *       schema validation, or whose evaluation throws, arrives as an
 *       honoured ACS `deny` decision -- never a bare JSON-RPC error.
 *       `denyOnInvalidEnvelope` (`packages/guardian/src/deny-on-invalid-
 *       envelope.ts`) is what does it, reached from two different catches in
 *       `server.ts` with two different reason codes: `envelope_invalid`
 *       (`dispatch`'s own catch) and `evaluation_failed` (`evaluateStep`'s
 *       catch). The assertions below that belong to this domain:
 *       `measureDenyColumn` drives one live probe per
 *       mapped point (never one probe generalised to all of them), and
 *       `assertEvaluationFailsClosed` drives one literal probe of its own, a
 *       `steps/toolCallRequest` whose payload fails
 *       `hooks/tool-call-request.json`.
 *
 *   (2) WIRE DELIVERY FAILURE APPLIES THE NEGOTIATED POSTURE. When no
 *       decision arrives at all -- the Guardian is unreachable, times out, or
 *       answers with an error and no `result` -- a `proceed` deployment
 *       proceeds and audits, a `deny` deployment blocks. THIS HALF IS THE
 *       HOST'S, not the Guardian's: the Guardian never applies a posture, it
 *       only ever answers with a decision or fails to answer at all.
 *       `packages/host-adapter/src/failure-posture.ts`'s `applyFailurePosture`
 *       reads `on_decision_failure` off the stored session config and decides
 *       the outcome; `session-config.ts`'s `isSessionConfig` validates that a
 *       stored config carries that field before `applyFailurePosture` can read
 *       it. `hosts/claude-code/acs-hook.ts` calls into this by way of
 *       `governStep` -- it does not apply the posture itself. It is measured
 *       end to end by
 *       `hosts/claude-code/test/posture.test.ts` (which drives a stub
 *       Guardian through every delivery-failure shape it can produce -- dead,
 *       timed out, error-without-decision -- against both postures) and is
 *       referenced here rather than re-driven: constructing a second copy of
 *       that suite inside a Guardian-only check would test the host's own
 *       code from a package that has no host in it.
 *
 * A THIRD BOUNDARY, distinct from both of the above and not a failure domain
 * of its own: DISPATCH. A well-formed envelope naming a method this Guardian
 * has no handler for answers `method_not_dispatched` (server.ts's own
 * `METHOD_NOT_DISPATCHED_CODE`), a plain JSON-RPC error, never a decision --
 * because there is no step here to answer for, which is the same reason
 * `denyOnInvalidEnvelope` is never reached by a handshake failure either. This
 * check posts an envelope naming a method `mapping.yaml` gives no row
 * to at all, and records that it comes back `method_not_dispatched` rather
 * than being swallowed into domain (1)'s deny-on-failure path -- proving the
 * two stay apart, not resolving any cell about it. What this check does not
 * do: `mapping.yaml` gives an `acs_method` to six intervention points, and
 * this Guardian dispatches two (`handshake.ts`'s `METHODS_EVALUATED`); the
 * other four answer `method_not_dispatched` too, live, but that is a
 * different fact -- a mapped-but-undispatched method, not an unmapped one --
 * and this check does not resolve a cell for it or draw a matrix-level
 * conclusion from it; the coverage-matrix merge and the published
 * declaration carry that fact forward instead.
 * `assertHookPayloadFailureIsUndispatchedElsewhere` below measures the same
 * boundary from validation's own side rather than dispatch's: the
 * hook-payload schemas `validateEnvelope` checks a payload against are gated
 * on the identical two method literals `METHODS_EVALUATED` names, in a
 * different file, so an empty payload is invalid only where this Guardian
 * also dispatches -- one seam, seen from validation and from dispatch.
 *
 * ONE LIVE PROBE PER MAPPED POINT, never one probe generalised to all of
 * them, because a single hook-payload probe cannot stand in for the other
 * five points: `checkHookPayload` applies a
 * hook-payload schema only for `steps/toolCallRequest` /
 * `steps/toolCallResult`, so an empty payload never fails validation at all
 * for the other four mapped methods -- they have no hook-payload schema to
 * fail, the envelope passes, and dispatch answers `method_not_dispatched`,
 * not a deny. Measured live: `steps/toolCallRequest` and
 * `steps/toolCallResult` return `decision=deny` for an empty payload;
 * `steps/sessionStart`, `steps/sessionEnd`, `steps/userMessage`,
 * `steps/agentResponse` each return a JSON-RPC error, code -32011.
 * `measureDenyColumn` below is what actually resolves the deny column: one
 * live probe per mapped point, using a generic `request-envelope.json`
 * failure (a missing `params.metadata`) rather than the method-gated
 * hook-payload one -- `validateTopLevel` (validate-envelope.ts's first
 * check) is not method-gated, so this failure mode genuinely does reach
 * `isStepMethod`'s gate identically for all six. Each cell in this file is
 * resolved by a probe naming the point it is a cell about, never by an
 * argument about routing.
