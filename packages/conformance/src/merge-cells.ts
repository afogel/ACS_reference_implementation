/**
 * The coverage matrix's merge step, split from rendering: the four
 * contributing checks each produce a `CoverageCell` for some or all of the
 * 40 (point, verdict) coordinates `everyCell()` enumerates, and this
 * combines however many of them touched each coordinate into the one cell
 * the matrix reports for it.
 *
 * THE RULE: the worst status wins -- `unexpressed` beats `guardian_only`
 * beats `expressed` -- and every contributing check is named in
 * `measuredBy`, regardless of which status it individually landed on. Two
 * checks that land on the SAME status -- the one the coordinate resolves to
 * -- have both their DISTINCT reasons carried, joined by `"; "`: one check's
 * account does not silence another's. Identical text from two checks is
 * deduped rather than joined against itself -- two checks reading the same
 * `mapping.yaml` note back verbatim is not a second account, and
 * `measuredBy` already names both of them regardless. A coordinate no check
 * touched resolves to
 * `unexpressed`, reason `"no check measured this cell"`, `measuredBy: []` --
 * the merge never marks a cell expressed by omission, which is the one way
 * this matrix could quietly turn green (`cells.ts`'s own `CellStatus` doc
 * names that failure mode and this is what closes it).
 *
 * `everyCell()` is what makes the return value always exactly 40 entries,
 * whether zero checks ran or all four did: the merge is driven by the full
 * coordinate space, not by whatever coordinates happened to arrive.
