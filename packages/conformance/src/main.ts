/**
 * The conformance runner. Publishes the two artifacts
 * `docs/shaping/acs-reference-impl-shaping.md`'s Parts table names as this
 * project's published artifacts -- the mapping table and the coverage
 * matrix -- and beside them a third table that table does not name: the
 * trace-pillar rows, which this package measures and renders separately.
 * The note under that table is explicit that it names only those two
 * published artifacts, so a reader comparing the two documents does not
 * mistake the trace-pillar rows for a discrepancy.
 *
 * This is a runner, not a test: its job is to drive every check this
 * package builds, merge their answers, render all three tables, and say
 * plainly which legs actually measured them -- not to assert anything about
 * the result itself. `bun run conformance` (scripts/run-conformance.sh) is
 * the one caller that runs it for real; `test/main.test.ts` is the other,
 * in-process, with the one leg that needs the network (below) left to
 * self-skip.
 *
 * FOUR CHECKS MERGED, AND A FIFTH BESIDE THEM: `checkInterventionPoints`,
 * `checkVerdicts`, `measureIdentity` (driven at both transform-capable
 * gates and merged -- it measures `pre_tool_call` as well as
 * `post_tool_call` because the two were found not to diverge, and a runner
 * calling it for one would narrow a measurement that was widened on
 * purpose; see identity.ts's own header), and `checkDenyFailsClosed`, fed to
 * `mergeCells` -- never concatenated, which is exactly the misuse
 * `renderCoverageMatrix`'s own duplicate-coordinate throw exists to catch
 * (render.ts's own header). `checkTracePillar` is separate: its
 * `TraceRow[]` has no (point, verdict) coordinate to merge into the matrix
 * at all, and is rendered on its own as the trace-pillar table.
 *
 * TWO OF THOSE ANSWER AT THEIR OWN GRAIN AND ARE PROJECTED HERE.
 * `checkInterventionPoints` answers per point and `measureIdentity` per
 * evaluation, so neither returns cells; `coverageCellsFromInterventionPoints`
 * and `coverageCellsFromIdentity` are the named stages that place what they
 * did measure onto the coordinates it actually covers. Neither stage
 * broadcasts an answer across an axis its check never read.
 *
 * THE SCHEMA LEG is orthogonal to the matrix: it asks whether the policy
 * input the Guardian actually constructs at `pre_tool_call` /
 * `post_tool_call` validates against AGT's own `policy-input.schema.json`,
 * which has no verdict axis to place a cell at (the same document
 * regardless of which verdict AGT eventually returns for it). It self-skips
 * without `PINNED_AGT_CLONE`, and the runner names -- on the output's own
 * face -- whether it ran, so a matrix published without it cannot be
 * mistaken for one that includes it.
 *
 * A GUARDIAN, STARTED AND CLOSED HERE, for the failure-domains check alone
 * (the only check that drives one over HTTP rather than in-process) --
 * `port: 0` so this runner never collides with a Guardian someone already
 * has listening on the runbook's default port, closed in a `finally` so a
 * check that throws (several of these do, deliberately, on a broken
 * invariant -- see e.g. failure-domains.ts's own header) never leaks the
 * listener.
