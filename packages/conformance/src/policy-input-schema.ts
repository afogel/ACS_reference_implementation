/**
 * The intervention-point check's schema leg. `checkInterventionPoints`
 * (intervention-points.ts) measures whether mapping.yaml's declared method
 * round-trips through the runtime's own resolver; this measures a different
 * question about the same table -- whether the policy input the Guardian
 * actually constructs on the way there is a document AGT itself would
 * accept, checked against AGT's own `policy-input.schema.json` rather than a
 * hand-written mirror of it kept in this repo. This check couples only to a
 * declared contract surface, since a copy of that surface authored here
 * could drift from upstream without this check saying so.
 *
 * `packages/agt-bridge/test/bridge.test.ts` already asserts the
 * constructed policy input has exactly the five members
 * `policy-input.schema.json` names (`additionalProperties: false` over
 * `intervention_point`, `policy_target`, `snapshot`, `annotations`, `tool`)
 * -- a shape assertion against a hand-written list. This is what turns it
 * into a check against AGT's real contract.
 *
 * SCOPED TO THE TWO POINTS THE GUARDIAN ACTUALLY CONSTRUCTS ONE FOR:
 * `pre_tool_call` and `post_tool_call` -- the only two AGT intervention
 * points this codebase has a real snapshot assembler for at all
 * (`packages/guardian/src/assemble-snapshot.ts`'s `assemblePreToolCall-
 * Snapshot` / `assemblePostToolCallSnapshot`), and the same two points the
 * enforced-identity check measures for the identical reason. "The policy
 * input the Guardian would send" is only a real question at these two; AGT's
 * other six points have no snapshot shape anywhere in this codebase to
 * construct one for, and inventing a plausible-looking one here would
 * measure this harness's own guess rather than the Guardian's real
 * behaviour (see e.g. verdicts.ts's own header on the same point).
 *
 * DOES NOT FETCH. Mirrors `scripts/verify-pin.sh`'s own pattern exactly: a
 * shell script (`scripts/run-conformance.sh`) clones AGT at the pinned ref
 * into a scratch temp dir and hands the path in by
 * `PINNED_AGT_CLONE`; this module self-skips -- returns `{ran: false}`,
 * never throws -- when that variable is absent, so `bun test` (which never
 * sets it) always exercises every check that does not need the network and
 * never performs one.
 *
 * PINNED, NOT UPSTREAM, and the distinction matters. This clone is
 * `agt.lock`'s locked ref -- the contract this repository is built against,
 * not AGT's moving `main`. A separate name is reserved for `main`
 * (`UpstreamSurfaces` beside `PinnedSurfaces`), and both will live in this
 * package once its drift watch exists. A differ told "upstream" twice is
 * exactly the failure that split was written to prevent, so this one says
 * which ref it means.
 *
 * A THROW, not a resolved finding, when a constructed policy input actually
 * FAILS validation -- the same choice `failure-domains.ts`'s
 * `assertEvaluationFailsClosed` makes for a broken invariant: this is not a
 * matrix cell (there is no verdict axis for a policy input; it is the same
 * document regardless of which verdict AGT eventually returns for it), and a
 * bridge that constructs a wire-invalid document is a real defect this
 * check must not fold into a quietly-published "did not validate" line.
