/**
 * N49. Whether a downstream consumer of the ACS v0.1.0 wire -- reading
 * nothing this Guardian keeps process-local -- could emit each required
 * Trace-pillar attribute `trace/otel-mapping.json` names. This is a CHECK,
 * not an exporter: nothing here is named `exportTrace`, `traceExporter` or
 * `emitSpan` (`slices/v7/README.md`, commitment 4). Its render half,
 * `renderTraceRows`, lives in `render.ts` -- that file's own PURE header is
 * why: `render.ts`'s only imports are `import type`, so it structurally
 * cannot read a file, and this module is where the reading happens instead.
 *
 * `otel-mapping.json` is a JSON **Schema**, not a data file -- its data
 * lives inside `default` keys, three places:
 *   - `properties.step_to_span.default` -- an object keyed by ACS method,
 *     18 entries, each `{span_name, required_attributes, optional_attributes?}`.
 *   - `properties.decision_event.properties.{required_attributes,
 *     conditional_attributes}.default` -- two string arrays.
 *   - `properties.provenance_attributes.properties.required.default` -- one
 *     string array.
 * A reader who expects the mapping to BE the data, rather than to declare a
 * schema whose `default` happens to carry it, looks at the top level and
 * finds nothing -- this module reads the three paths above, not the schema
 * shape around them.
 *
 * SCOPE: the six ACS methods `mapping.yaml`'s `intervention_points` table
 * gives an `acs_method` (`steps/toolCallRequest`, `steps/toolCallResult`,
 * `steps/sessionStart`, `steps/sessionEnd`, `steps/userMessage`,
 * `steps/agentResponse`) -- R5.3 is about what THIS implementation claims,
 * and it can only claim or decline the Trace pillar for the methods it
 * evaluates. `otel-mapping.json` declares eighteen; the other twelve
 * (`steps/agentTrigger`, `steps/knowledgeRetrieval`, `steps/memoryStore`,
 * `steps/memoryContextRetrieval`, `steps/turnStart`, `steps/turnEnd`,
 * `steps/preCompact`, `steps/postCompact`, `steps/subagentStart`,
 * `steps/subagentStop`, `agbom/snapshot`, `agbom/changed`) are out of scope
 * for the same reason `mapping.yaml` never reaches them. The six are frozen
 * here rather than re-read from `mapping.yaml`: this module's interface
 * consumes nothing from earlier tasks, so the scope is a stated design fact
 * (which methods this Guardian evaluates), not something re-derived from a
 * file this check would otherwise have to import.
 *
 * THE RULE: a row is emittable only when its field is PRESENT and REQUIRED
 * in the v0.1.0 schema that would carry it. An optional field means a
 * conformant envelope may omit it, so a wire consumer cannot be relied on to
 * emit the attribute -- present-but-optional and absent-entirely are both
 * "not emittable", but they are different findings, and each row's `reason`
 * says which. Both are resolved by `resolveField` below, at runtime, against
 * the actual parsed schema files: nothing here hardcodes a row's verdict,
 * only which file and field path a given attribute WOULD resolve against
 * (the "wire site"), which is domain knowledge no schema states directly --
 * `otel-mapping.json` names `acs.capability`, not
 * `hooks/tool-call-request.json`'s `capability` field.
 *
 * Decision facts (`acs.decision`, `acs.evaluator`, and the four conditional
 * attributes) are recorded as a span EVENT named `acs.decision` on the
 * parent step span -- not a span of their own -- so every row built from
 * `decision_event` carries that literal string as its `span`, matching
 * `otel-mapping.json`'s own `event_name` const. Provenance attributes are
 * plainer still: `provenance_attributes`'s own description says they land
 * as ordinary attributes "on the resulting span" whichever step that is, so
 * that row's `span` is a parenthesised description rather than a literal
 * OTel name -- there is no single step span to point at. This is why
 * `TraceRow.span` (below) is typed as a bare `string`: a caller reading it
 * off a `TraceRow` this module returns cannot assume it is always a literal
 * OTel span or event name -- two of the eighteen rows' `span` values are
 * not.
 *
 * WHAT `resolveField` DOES NOT MODEL: JSON Schema's conditional-requirement
 * keywords (`allOf`/`if`/`then`), which `response-envelope.json`'s
 * `$defs.AcsResult` uses to require `reasoning` when `decision` is `deny`,
 * `modify`, `ask` or `defer`. `resolveField` only ever reads a node's own
 * unconditional `required` array, so `acs.reasoning`'s row reads "exists but
 * is optional" -- true of `AcsResult` generally (its top-level `required`
 * omits `reasoning`), but only because `allow` is the one decision that
 * carries no such conditional obligation; a `deny`/`modify`/`ask`/`defer`
 * result DOES require it. The verdict this rule produces is still correct
 * under this module's own stated definition ("required" means "in the
 * schema's own unconditional `required` list"), and none of the other six
 * files this module reads uses `allOf`/`if`/`then` on a path any site here
 * walks -- `AcsResult` is the only one.
 *
 * `acs.provenance.origin` is measured under a narrower rule than every other
 * row, and that is deliberate, not an inconsistency left unstated. Every
 * other row asks "starting from a construct guaranteed to exist once per
 * step (a hook payload, the envelope's own metadata, the one `acs.decision`
 * event) is this field present and unconditionally required", walking the
 * FULL path including whatever optional container sits in between --
 * `acs.evaluator`'s path walks through `AcsResult.metadata`, itself optional
 * on `AcsResult`, and that optionality is exactly what makes the row red.
 * Provenance has no such always-present parent in scope: nothing in the six
 * in-scope spans' `required_attributes` names a `provenance` field, and
 * whether a `Provenance` object is attached at all is a per-argument,
 * per-output, per-content-item choice (`provenance.json`'s own consumers
 * describe it as "OPTIONAL in the base schema") that this module's sites
 * never walk into. `otel-mapping.json`'s own text scopes
 * `provenance_attributes.required` the same way -- "When Provenance is
 * attached to a hook payload, the resulting span MUST carry provenance
 * facts as attributes" -- so this row measures exactly that conditional
 * claim: GIVEN a `Provenance` object, is `origin` guaranteed within it. It
 * does not, and could not from the sites this module reads, additionally
 * ask whether a `Provenance` object is ever attached in the first place.
