/**
 * Recomputes AGT's action identity instead of taking its word for it, and
 * reports what that identity actually binds to.
 *
 * MEASURED, not read from AGT's docs: the identity is the SHA-256 of the
 * key-sorted, whitespace-free JSON of the policy input, prefixed "sha256:".
 * `enforced_identity` is the same hash after replacing `policy_target.value`
 * alone with `verdict.transform.value` -- the snapshot's own copy of that leaf
 * is not updated. Both reproduce exactly against the pinned SDK.
 *
 * MEASURED AT BOTH TRANSFORM-CAPABLE POINTS, not assumed to agree because one
 * was checked. mapping.yaml gives a `modifications` rule to `pre_tool_call`
 * and `post_tool_call` alike, and `policy/lib/agt_default.rego`'s
 * `redact_verdict` reads `input.policy_target.value` without consulting
 * `input.intervention_point` -- so the pinned bundle's stock redact rule can
 * fire at either gate, and the binding question is a real question at both.
 * Driven independently (`test/identity.test.ts`), the request gate resolves
 * `policy_target` too, identically to the result gate -- not forced to agree,
 * found to.
 *
 * The second half is the finding, and it is why this cell resolves
 * guardian-only rather than expressed. AGT's enforced identity binds to the
 * policy target it rewrote, not to the document the host will execute; making
 * those agree is the adapter's job, and ACS v0.1.0 carries no field to check
 * it with. `identity` occurs four times, across two files, in the whole
 * v0.1.0 spec directory -- three inside `session-start.json` (the
 * `user_identity` field name and two prose uses in its own description) and
 * one more in prose inside `skill-register.json` -- and none of the four is
 * this. The nearest miss is
 * `context-entry.json`'s `request_hash` (context-entry.json:21-24): SHA-256
 * of the JCS-canonicalised request envelope params. It does not name what
 * this check measures either -- it is not wire-transmitted (context-
 * entry.json:5, "not transmitted in full on the wire") and it commits to the
 * request as received, not to the policy target after AGT's own
 * modifications.
 *
 * A RECOMPUTATION, which is why this takes the policy input and the transform
 * and nothing else. AGT also returns `transformedPolicyTarget`, its own
 * already-transformed value; `AgtEvidence` deliberately does not carry it,
 * because a check handed AGT's answer has a way to agree with AGT without
 * computing anything.
