/**
 * The gate that reads a document and asserts it against the program.
 *
 * Every other check in this tree reads code, config, or a log. Nothing read a
 * doc -- and README.md's quickstart is the first thing anyone runs, so its
 * fenced blocks are the most-read output this project produces and the least
 * checked. V6 gave the Guardian a fourth startup line and rewrote the
 * Inspector's banner entirely, re-transcribed neither, and the suite stayed
 * green through the whole slice. That is the failure this file closes: not the
 * stale lines themselves, which are a morning's work, but the absence of
 * anything that would have said so.
 *
 * The repo's convention, which this enforces rather than introduces, is that a
 * fenced block following a command is a CAPTURE of that command -- pasted from
 * a run, not composed from reading the source. `hosts/claude-code/test/posture.test.ts`
 * already asserts one string is "byte-for-byte what docs/demos/v3-runbook.md
 * captures", but against a hardcoded literal, so the doc and the test could
 * drift together and still agree. `test/path-dialects.test.ts` machine-checks
 * two config artifacts against each other. This is the same rail carried over
 * the last boundary: the document is the expected value, and the program's real
 * stdout is the actual one.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, stated because a reader is entitled to the edge.
 * Only the two startup banners. The envelope and decision-badge captures
 * further down the quickstart need a governed step to produce, and the runbooks
 * under docs/demos/ are not read here at all. A doc claim outside those two
 * fences is still only as true as whoever last measured it.

/**
 * Runs one of the two long-lived processes from a scratch cwd and returns what
 * it printed.
 *
 * `lines` is the number of lines the document claims, and the process is
 * killed as soon as that many are in hand -- but the loop then keeps draining
 * to the end of the stream instead of returning, and that is what catches a
 * line the doc does NOT have. Both entrypoints print their whole banner in one
 * synchronous run of `console.log` calls before doing anything else, so an
 * extra line is already in the pipe by the time the kill lands and shows up
 * as a mismatch. The edge: a banner line emitted after a later tick would be
 * missed. Neither file has one, and a new one would belong with its siblings.
 *
 * `timeout` is the runtime's own watchdog rather than a test-side timer, and
 * it is deliberately shorter than bun test's own five-second per-test cap: a
 * banner MISSING a documented line never reaches that line count, so the
 * drain has to be ended by something, and it should be this rather than the
 * harness. The wait is paid only when the document is already wrong -- a
 * healthy run returns as soon as the documented number of lines arrives, in
 * well under a tenth of a second. So a process that never prints its banner
 * fails on the comparison, with a diff naming the line it did not print,
 * instead of dying of a bun-test timeout whose message points nowhere near
 * the cause -- the same reasoning that bounds the tailer in
 * test/session-context-roundtrip.test.ts.
 *
 * The environment is built up rather than inherited: `ACS_ON_DECISION_FAILURE=deny`
 * or a stray `ACS_ENVELOPE_LOG` in the developer's shell would otherwise
 * change the banner and fail this test for a reason that has nothing to do
 * with the document.
