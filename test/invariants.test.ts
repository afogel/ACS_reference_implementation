/**
 * `hosts/opencode/acs-plugin.ts` decides what a hookmap must declare for each

 * and `CARRIED_AT_RESULT_GATE` -- which say, per gate per decision, which
 * decision field that decision actually arrives carrying (or `null` for "it
 * carries nothing this host could land, so refusing is its only honest shape").
 *
 * Those tables are a fail-open generator if they are wrong. Two concrete ways
 * they can be wrong, both silent without this gate:
 *
 *   - the result gate's table could claim `ask`/`defer` carry `applied_output`.
 *     `withResultOutput` returns both untouched, so the sink the gate demanded
 *     would be unfillable and a real `ask` would deliver the tool's output in
 *     the leaf and its mirror.
 *   - the request gate's table could claim `modify` carries `applied_input`.
 *     That is true only while the entry declares `arguments:` -- an entry
 *     declaring `outputs:` gets an output location, and `resolveModify` fills
 *     `applied_output` instead.
 *
 * A table hand-derived from another package's behaviour can go stale the
 * moment that package changes, and the failure direction is silent
 * (over-refusal is loud; under-refusal is a delivered secret). This gate is
 * what makes it loud in both directions: for every decision name at both
 * gates it asks the adapter what that decision ends up carrying, and asserts
 * the answer matches the table the shim is enforcing.
 *
 * Which adapter function answers depends on the decision. `withResultOutput`
 * decides `allow`/`deny`/`ask`/`defer`. `modify` is `resolveModify`'s -- it is
 * the only decision whose table entry differs between the two gates, since
 * `resolveModify` decides which field a `modify` carries off exactly the
 * `outputLocation` presence the two tables differ on. This gate calls
 * `resolveModify` itself rather than hand-seeding the field it asserts,
 * because re-implementing that branch inline would make the request-gate
 * assertion a tautology: `withResultOutput(x, undefined)` returns `x` by
 * identity regardless of whether the branch under test is correct.
 *
 * Lives here, not in hosts/opencode/test/, for the reason this file states
 * for its own sibling gates: the claim needs two artifacts at once -- the
 * shim's table and the adapter's behaviour -- and neither package's own
 * suite owns both. Same placement argument as the `tools`-at-PreToolUse gate
 * and the export-count gate above.
 *
 * This package's boundary -- knowing ACS and hookmaps, nothing else -- is
 * not at risk from this file naming `applied_input`/`applied_output`: those
 * are ACS's own decision-message vocabulary, not any host's field names, and
 * the vocabulary gates above deliberately scope to
