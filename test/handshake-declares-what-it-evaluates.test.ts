/**
 * THE HANDSHAKE HAS TO DESCRIBE THE GUARDIAN THAT SENT IT.
 *
 * `methods_evaluated` is not documentation. handshake.json defines it as the
 * "Subset of the client's methods_implemented that this Guardian will actually
 * evaluate", and then says what a client must do with the difference: "Methods
 * listed by the client but absent here are NOT evaluated; the Guardian's
 * enforcement does not cover them. Clients MAY still emit them for audit but
 * MUST treat them as ALLOW-by-default."
 *
 * So the two failure directions are not symmetric in kind, only in badness:
 *
 *   - UNDER-DECLARING tells a conformant host to ignore a gate that is really
 *     enforcing. This is the one that actually happened. V4 wired
 *     `steps/toolCallResult` -- the slice's whole point, a redaction gate --
 *     while the ServerHello went on naming `steps/toolCallRequest` alone under
 *     a comment reading "only intervention point wired in V1". This host never
 *     reads the field, which is exactly why nothing noticed for a whole slice.
 *   - OVER-DECLARING claims enforcement that does not exist, which a host is
 *     entitled to rely on. Nothing has done it yet, and it is the direction a
 *     "just add the method to the list" fix invites next time.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A TEST RATHER THAN A DERIVED CONSTANT. What must hold is a
 * property of the running Guardian: it declares exactly what it dispatches.
 * Dispatch is two predicate-gated branches in server.ts, deliberately not a
 * table -- that module argues at length that a table keyed on the resolved
 * intervention point would hand one method's envelope to another method's
 * assembler and answer with a well-formed verdict for the wrong policy. There
 * is no expression `buildServerHello` could evaluate to learn "what server.ts
 * branches on". Deriving the list from, say, validate-envelope's method
 * constants would pin something NARROWER -- that a predicate exists -- and
 * leave both failures above reachable: a predicate with no branch would
 * over-declare, and a branch is what makes a method evaluated. So the
 * declaration stays a literal and the RELATIONSHIP is measured, by asking a
 * live Guardian which methods it answers for.
