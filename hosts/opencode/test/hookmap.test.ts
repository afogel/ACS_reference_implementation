/**
 * opencode.hookmap.yaml's load-time contract: it loads, maps both gates onto

 * (`outputs.mirrors`), and expresses a request-gate deny as a refusal but a
 * result-gate deny as a replacement -- never a throw, because a throw at the
 * result gate discards the plugin's mutations and OpenCode rebuilds `metadata`
 * from its own pre-hook copy (measured).
 *
 * Same shape as hosts/claude-code/test/hook.test.ts's own hookmap coverage;
 * this file is scoped to the hookmap alone, not the plugin shim.
