 * request-gate.test.ts sets for this host's other gate, and

 * (apply-host-output.test.ts, hookmap.test.ts, acs-plugin.test.ts); this is
 * the first one that calls THIS hook the way OpenCode itself would.
 *
 * THE MIRROR IS THE POINT. `opencode.hookmap.yaml`'s result gate declares

 * copy of the tool's output, and a redaction that patched only the leaf would
 * leave the plaintext sitting in OpenCode's own session record while the
 * model correctly saw the redaction. The whole reason this slice touched the
 * shared adapter a second time is to prove that mirror lands, end to end,

 * refused hookmap actually DOES if it ever reaches a live decision, which is the
 * claim the gate rests on. So these call the same collaborators

 * `governStep`, `applyOpenCodeOutput`), against the same live Guardian and the
 * same real decisions, with the plugin factory -- and therefore the gate -- out
 * of the path. They keep measuring the hazard after the gate lands.
 *
 * Every fixture below is a few lines different from the shipped
 * `opencode.hookmap.yaml`'s result gate, and every one of them LOADS CLEAN
 * through `loadHookmap`: `assertRenderableDecisions` (build-envelope.ts)
 * requires only a non-empty `output` block whose every field names a `value` or
