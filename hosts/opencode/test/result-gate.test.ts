 * sets for the Claude Code host's own result gate. `applyOpenCodeOutput` in
 * isolation, the shipped hookmap's static shape, and `AcsPlugin`'s own
 * load-time gate already have their own suites (apply-opencode-output.test.ts,
 * hookmap.test.ts, acs-plugin.test.ts); this is the first one that calls this
 * hook the way OpenCode itself would.
 *
 * The mirror is the point. `opencode.hookmap.yaml`'s result gate declares
 * `outputs.mirrors: [$.result.metadata.output]` -- `metadata` carries its own
 * copy of the tool's output, and a redaction that patched only the leaf would
 * leave the plaintext sitting in OpenCode's own session record while the
 * model correctly saw the redaction. Proving that mirror lands, end to end,
 * through the unmodified adapter, on a second host, is the whole point of

 * cleanly on its own, and the fix is a load-time refusal in `AcsPlugin`.
 * Driving these through `AcsPlugin` would prove only that the refusal fires,

 * the refused hookmap actually does if it ever reaches a live decision,
 * which is the claim the gate rests on. So these call the same collaborators
 * `"tool.execute.after"` above calls (`loadHookmap`, `resolveSessionConfig`
 * -> `governStep`, `applyOpenCodeOutput`), against the same live Guardian and
 * the same real decisions, with the plugin factory -- and therefore the gate
 * -- out of the path. They keep measuring the hazard the gate exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * Every fixture below is a few lines different from the shipped
 * `opencode.hookmap.yaml`'s result gate, and every one of them loads clean
 * through `loadHookmap`: `assertRenderableDecisions` (build-envelope.ts)
 * requires only a non-empty `output` block whose every field names a `value`
 * or a `from`, and `reason.text: { from: reasoning }` satisfies that exactly.
