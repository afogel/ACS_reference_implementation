/**
 * acs-plugin.ts -- OpenCode's ACS plugin shim against packages/host-adapter,
 * the same package the Claude Code shim uses. Nothing here forks the adapter
 * for this host: whatever this host needed landed in host-adapter/src, which
 * both hosts run, and hosts/claude-code/acs-hook.ts is untouched by this
 * file's existence.
 *
 * This is not hosts/claude-code/acs-hook.ts with a different name. Claude
 * Code's shim is a fresh subprocess per hook: it reads one JSON object on
 * stdin, calls resolveSessionConfig then governStep, and writes the rendered
 * HostOutput to stdout with an exit code. OpenCode is a different shape of
 * host entirely -- one plugin object, loaded once, whose hook methods return
 * void and are handed live, mutable objects (`{args}` at the request gate,
 * `{title, output, metadata, attachments}` at the result gate). There is no
 * document to write and no exit code to set: the only channel back to
 * OpenCode is mutating what it handed us, or throwing. So the same rendered
 * `HostOutput`, from the same `governStep` -> `renderDecision`, is applied
 * here instead of printed, and applying it is the one piece of host semantics
 * this file owns (`applyOpenCodeOutput`, apply-opencode-output.ts).
 *
 * Four things every gate must do at runtime, none of them knowable until a
 * hook actually fires, so none of them is a load-time check. `runExchange`
 * (below) is the single function both hook methods call, so all four happen
 * in one place rather than in two hook bodies kept in step by hand:
 *
 *   - Validate `sessionID` -- present, a non-empty string -- and refuse
 *     before calling `governStep`. `buildEnvelope` already throws on a
 *     missing `session_id`, but that throw lands inside `governStep`'s
 *     stage-"request" catch and is answered by the deployment's negotiated
 *     posture, where a negotiated proceed there would be an ungoverned step.
 *     A missing session id is a broken deployment, not a policy question, so
 *     it is refused here instead. Only the typeof half of the check: the
 *     Claude Code shim's own session id check adds a second, path-safety
 *     half, because its session config store is file-backed and the session
 *     id becomes part of a filesystem path. This host's store (in memory,
 *     see below) is keyed by nothing that ever becomes a filename, so there
 *     is no path-safety hazard here to close.
 *   - Use a throw as the only failure mechanism. OpenCode's hooks return
 *     `void` and have no other channel to report a failure through -- the
 *     same mechanism `applyOpenCodeOutput`'s own `refuse` path uses.
 *   - Know that a throw at the result gate is weaker than one at the request
 *     gate. `opencode.hookmap.yaml`'s own header records the measurement: a
 *     throw at `tool.execute.after` stops the model from ever seeing the
 *     tool's output, but OpenCode discards the plugin's mutations on that
 *     path and rebuilds `metadata` from its own pre-hook copy, so whatever
 *     the tool actually produced survives in OpenCode's own session record
 *     regardless of how early the throw fires. That is why the shipped
 *     hookmap's result-gate `deny`/`modify` withhold by replacing `result`
 *     (`applyOpenCodeOutput`'s merge) rather than by throwing. A sessionID
 *     check that refuses at the result gate is still the right call -- an
 *     ungoverned step is worse than a stop that does not scrub the disk --
 *     but a throw there does not mean the secret is contained the way it
 *     would at the request gate.
 *   - Assemble `session_id: input.sessionID` onto the payload raw, not
 *     pre-converted. `buildEnvelope` reads `payload.session_id` as a
 *     hardcoded top-level field and derives the ACS uuid itself; the uuid
 *     form (`toSessionUuid(input.sessionID)`) is for a different call --
 *     `resolveSessionConfig` takes the uuid, `governStep` takes the raw host
 *     id for the audit log entry. Mixing the two is the bug this note exists
 *     to prevent.
 *
 * A gate also trusts, rather than re-checks, that a decision which must
 * refuse, withhold or rewrite has somewhere to do it: `assertHostAcceptsEveryDecision`
 * (below), called at load time from `AcsPlugin`, refuses a hookmap unless
 * every declared decision at every gate can either land what it arrives
 * carrying or refuse outright -- the silent no-op is the only outcome that is
 * never accepted. See `satisfiesGate` and `CARRIED_AT_REQUEST_GATE`/
 * `CARRIED_AT_RESULT_GATE` (below) for exactly what each decision may do at
 * each gate.
 *
 * And a gate honours `tools` before any of that, except validating `tool`
 * itself: a hookmap entry that declares a `tools` list must return, without
 * building a payload or calling `resolveSessionConfig`/`governStep`, for any
 * tool that list does not name (`governsTool`, imported from the adapter). A
 * gate with no `tools` check would not govern every tool it is asked about;
 * it would deny every tool its deployment's policy target cannot name, and
 * call that governance. `tool` itself is validated first, ahead of the
 * `tools` check, because `Array.prototype.includes` does not throw on a
 * malformed `tool` -- it silently answers `false`, which reads as "out of
 * scope" rather than as the broken deployment it actually is.
 *
 * The store is in memory. The Claude Code shim is a fresh subprocess per
 * hook, so its session config store is file-backed
 * (`createFileSessionConfigStore`). This plugin is one long-lived object for
 * the whole session -- OpenCode calls the plugin factory once, and every hook
 * after that fires against the closure this factory returns -- so the
 * negotiated config survives in a variable and the second hook of a session
 * skips the handshake round trip entirely. One interface
 * (`SessionConfigStore`), two implementations, and `resolveSessionConfig`/
 * `governStep` never learn which host they are running under.
 *
 * This file may name OpenCode freely -- it is host-specific by definition --
 * but it may only reach into host-adapter's public surface, never into
 * agt-bridge or guardian's server-side pieces, and it talks to the Guardian
 * only over HTTP through `createGuardianClient`. `test/invariants.test.ts`'s
 * "every host shim imports the adapter only" gate checks this mechanically,
 * against this file by name.

/**
 * The rule this whole gate is about, stated once as a table instead of as a
 * list of accepted shapes: a declared decision must be able to land what it
 * actually arrives carrying at this gate, or to unconditionally refuse. The
 * silent no-op is the only outcome that is never accepted.
 *
 * Which makes the whole gate one question asked twice: what does this
 * decision arrive carrying here? These two tables answer it, and nothing
 * below decides it ad hoc.
 *
 *   - A decision field name means: it arrives carrying that field, so it may
 *     land it (a correctly-declared sink) or refuse.
 *   - `null` means: it arrives carrying nothing this host could land, so
 *     refusing is the only honest shape open to it.
 *   - Absent from the table means: not this check's business. `allow` is the
 *     only such decision, at either gate, and deliberately -- rendering
 *     nothing IS its own meaning ("nothing to change" / "deliver the output
 *     as the tool produced it"), the same distinction `acs-hook.ts`'s
 *     `emptyOutputIsHonest` draws between the Claude Code shim's two gates.
 *
 * A list of accepted shapes, rather than a statement of what each decision
 * carries, is the wrong basis for this rule: a rule widening the result
 * gate to require a sink for `ask`/`defer` reached this gate before anyone
 * asked whether that sink can ever be filled for them. It cannot --
 * `withResultOutput` (result-output.ts) attaches `applied_output` for `deny`
 * alone, throws for a `modify` arriving without one, and returns everything
 * else -- `allow`, `ask`, `defer` -- untouched. So `result: { from:
 * applied_output }` on a result-gate `ask`, the exact declaration such a
 * rule would require, renders no `result` key at all: the applier applies
 * nothing, throws nothing, and the secret is delivered in the leaf and its
 * mirror both (result-gate.test.ts). A table that states what each decision
 * carries makes that unwritable; a list of shapes did not.

 *     naming something under it (`result.output`, `args.command`) renders a
 *     nested object, which the applier merges one level too deep -- landing
 *     the whole container in a field that holds a leaf, and leaving the
 *     mirror unwritten.
 *   - The source field, not merely that some source is named. A `from:`
 *     field renders nothing when the arriving decision does not carry that
 *     source (render-decision.ts), so `result: { from: applied_input }`
 *     declares the right key against a field a result-gate decision never
 *     carries: it renders no `result` key at all, the applier applies
 *     nothing and throws nothing, and the tool's output is delivered in the
 *     leaf and its mirror both.
 *   - No `type:`, or `type: "object"`. `type` is a `typeof` filter, and
 *     `renderDecision` drops a `from:` field whose carried value fails it --
 *     the same skip an absent source takes. `applied_output` and
 *     `applied_input` are both objects, so `type: string` never matches and
 *     the field never renders.
 *   - No `value:` key, even beside a correct `from:`. `renderDecision`
 *     checks for an own `value` property first and stops there -- it never
 *     reads `from` at all, so `result: { value: {}, from: applied_output }`
 *     renders `{"result":{}}`, which the applier merges, merging nothing.
 *
 * A literal at the sink is refused for a reason worth keeping: a hookmap
 * could land something that way, but not the decision's own withholding or
 * rewrite -- it would be a fixed value the Guardian never chose, applied
 * identically to every decision, which is a hardcoded answer wearing
 * governance's clothes. The only thing that honours an arriving decision

 *
 * What a refusal costs at the result gate, said plainly. It is a weaker

 * mutations on that path and rebuilds `metadata` from its own pre-hook
 * copy, so the plaintext survives in OpenCode's own session record. Weaker,
 * and still honest, and still far better than the alternative this gate

 * below, which makes the one `applyOpenCodeOutput` call). That makes two
 * things facts about the shim rather than choices left to a hookmap -- and a
 * hookmap disagreeing with either produces an entry that satisfies every
 * other check here while governing nothing:
 *
 *   - Which payload shape this hook builds. `governStep` and `buildEnvelope`
 *     read that off the entry's shape (`arguments` vs `outputs`) and never
 *     off the event name, deliberately, so a typo in an event name cannot
 *     silently select the wrong behaviour. This shim decides the same
 *     question by hook name, because its two hook methods hardcode
 *     `{gate: "request", args}` and `{gate: "result", result}`. When the two
 *     disagree, the decision that arrives is shaped for the other gate -- a
 *     request hook declaring `outputs:` gets an output location it should
 *     not have, so `resolveModify` (decision-modify.ts) fills
 *     `applied_output` instead of `applied_input`, and the
 *     `args: { from: applied_input }` this gate requires becomes correct,
 *     declared, and unfillable: the rewrite lands nowhere while `governStep`
 *     still reports `stage: "honoured"`.
 *   - Which paths resolve against what this shim assembled. `tool_name` must
 *     name `$.tool`, because that is the field this shim's own payload
 *     assembly puts `input.tool` in, and `tool_name` is what `buildEnvelope`
 *     reads to name the tool on the wire -- pointing it elsewhere asks the
 *     policy runtime about a value it never governed (measured: a `deny`
 *     rule went unconsulted because the field actually evaluated was the
 *     tool's title, not its command, so the step was audited as a clean
 *     allow). `outputs.within` must name `$.result`, because that is where
 *     this shim puts the live object it hands the applier: an
 *     `applied_output` is a patched clone of that container, so naming
 *     another one lands the clone at a depth the applier then merges
 *     wrongly, leaving the mirror unwritten or merging junk keys onto
 *     OpenCode's own live object.
 *
 * `outputs.mirrors` is deliberately not fixed here, and the asymmetry with
 * `outputs.from`/`within` is the point rather than an oversight. Which
 * container the live object is, and which leaf inside it is the tool's
 * output, are both facts about the shape this shim assembles -- fixed, so
 * checked. Where that leaf is mirrored is not: `metadata` is per-tool on
 * this host (`bash`'s carries `exit`/`output`, `read`'s carries `preview`,
 * `grep`'s carries `matches` -- opencode.hookmap.yaml's own measurement
 * table), so a second deployment scoping this gate to a different tool
 * would name a different mirror, or none. Nothing here could say which is
 * right.
 *
 * That leaves two things genuinely open, worth stating rather than leaving
 * implicit. First, a hookmap that omits `mirrors` entirely is not refused,
 * and it leaks: a real `deny` withholds the leaf and leaves the secret
 * standing in the unmirrored field. This is not closed here, because the
 * same freedom that makes it possible is what lets a second deployment
 * declare the right mirror at all. Second, the bound on that leak rests on
 * this entry's own `tools: [bash]` scope, which `fixedPaths` above does not
 * pin: without it, a `read`-shaped result whose `metadata` carries no
 * `exit` makes `buildEnvelope` throw, which the deployment's negotiated
 * posture can answer with a proceed -- a delivered secret through a
 * hookmap this gate loaded cleanly, with the step never asked about at
 * all. Neither gap weakens `declaresSinkFrom`'s own checks; both are
 * properties of a differently-shaped hookmap this check does not, and
 * structurally cannot, rule out.
 *
 * `mirrors` is not what holds either of those shut, which matters before
 * touching either line: `replacingOutput` (result-output.ts) already
 * refuses to build a withholding when a declared mirror resolves to no
 * value in the payload, which is the guard that actually protects a
 * `mirrors`-scoped deployment. That guard runs over whatever mirrors a
 * hookmap declares, so a deployment that declares none simply never arms
 * it -- correctly, by its own design, since it was told there is no mirror
 * to check.
 *
 * The adapter cannot make any of these checks itself, and that is
 * deliberate on its side rather than an omission: every one rests on
 * knowing which hook name is which gate, and on what this shim's own
 * payload assembly named. Only a host shim has both.

 * output field this host's applier would honour that way -- called from
 * `AcsPlugin`, beside `loadHookmap`, so this is a load-time stop rather than
 * a fault this shim could only discover from a live decision.
 *
 * Load time, not posture time, and that is the whole point. This fault is
 * decidable from the hookmap file alone, with no invocation payload,
 * rather than left to surface downstream, where a throw is caught by
 * `governStep` and answered by the deployment's negotiated delivery
 * posture instead of refused outright. A negotiated proceed there is an
 * ungoverned step -- and at the result gate an ungoverned step is the
 * tool's output, secret included, delivered.
 *
 * This cannot live in `loadHookmap`, host-agnostically: it is this host's
 * own rule about what its applier needs -- which decisions exist, which
 * output key refuses, which one withholds -- not a claim
 * packages/host-adapter/src may make about any host's field names. For
 * `refuse` that is enforced mechanically: test/invariants.test.ts's
 * host-vocabulary gate fails on the word appearing anywhere in the
 * adapter's own source. Not for `result`: `result-output.ts` uses "result"
 * for ACS's own replacing-output concept, so listing it there would fail
 * on day one for a word the adapter is supposed to speak. What keeps
 * `result`-as-an-OpenCode-output-key out of the adapter is this function
 * living here, not a gate -- the same reason `assertHostAcceptsEveryDecision`
 * lives in hosts/claude-code/acs-hook.ts rather than in the adapter.
 *
 * What this still does not do, stated so a reader does not read more into
 * it. It is a check on the hookmap, not on a rendered output: a hookmap
 * that declares the right key and source, and a decision that reaches the
 * render carrying nothing to put in it, are different faults, and only the
 * first is decidable here -- the same split `acs-hook.ts` draws between its
 * own load-time check and `asClaudeCodeOutput`'s runtime one. It also asks
 * nothing of `allow` at either gate (rendering nothing is that decision's
 * own meaning at both) and nothing about a decision the hookmap never
 * declares. And it does not rank the two honest outcomes: a hookmap that
 * refuses where it could have replaced passes, with the trade-off spelled
 * out in the error message an author sees on the way to choosing.

 *   - `assertUsableTool` first, ahead of the `tools` check, because

 *     answers a silent `false`, which reads as "out of scope" and turns an
 *     audited, posture-answered fault into a silent unaudited proceed.
 *   - `governsTool`'s early return before `assertUsableSessionId`, so a
 *     tool this gate does not govern costs no session validation and no
 *     handshake round trip. `governStep` asks the same function itself,
 *     about the very value this function hands it (`scopedTool`), so a
 *     shim that forgot would still skip; this call site is the only one
 *     early enough to skip the rest as well.
 *   - `assertUsableSessionId` before `governStep`, because `buildEnvelope`'s
 *     own throw on a missing `session_id` lands in `governStep`'s
 *     stage-"request" catch and is answered by the negotiated posture,
 *     where a proceed is an ungoverned step.
 *
 * Payload assembly stays at the edge, called from here rather than done
 * here, because the two gates genuinely differ: the request gate reads
 * `args` off the mutable `output` object OpenCode hands it (the only place
 * OpenCode puts them at that gate), while the result gate reads `args` off
 * `input` directly and passes the whole live `{title, output, metadata,
 * attachments}` object as `result`. Called in the ordered position -- after
 * both validations, not before -- and handed the two values this function
 * has just checked, so a gate cannot put an unvalidated `tool` or
 * `sessionID` on its payload.
 *
 * Both `sessionId` forms are here, which is why this is where the note
 * belongs: `resolveSessionConfig` takes the derived ACS uuid
 * (`toSessionUuid`), `governStep` takes the raw host id for the audit log
 * entry, and the payload carries the raw one too because `buildEnvelope`
 * reads `payload.session_id` as a hardcoded top-level field and derives
 * the uuid itself. Mixing the two is the exact bug this note exists to
 * prevent -- see acs-hook.ts's own step 4 and step 5 for the Claude Code
