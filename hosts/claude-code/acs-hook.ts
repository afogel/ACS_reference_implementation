/**
 * acs-hook.ts -- Claude Code's PreToolUse hook shim.
 *
 * Thin, and actually thin: read the hook JSON Claude Code sends on stdin,
 * hand it to `resolveSessionConfig` -> `governStep` (both from `host-adapter`,
 * packages/host-adapter), wrap the output that comes back into the JSON Claude
 * Code expects, and write it to stdout. This file branches on nothing about a
 * decision: inspecting the response for one, and tracking which stage of an
 * exchange failed, are both `govern-step.ts`'s job, host-agnostically, and
 * everything it has to preserve is documented there rather than here -- so a
 * second shim gets it by calling the function instead of by copying this
 * file. What remains here is the wiring a Claude Code hook process needs
 * (stdin, stdout, exit code, which hookmap file to load) plus the one thing
 * the adapter must not know: this host's own output shape. A second host
 * arrives as another shim this thin against the same, unchanged adapter;
 * any logic added here is logic that host would have to duplicate.
 *
 * This file is host-specific by definition (it may name Claude Code
 * freely) but must not reach into AGT -- it never imports `agt-bridge` or
 * `guardian`'s server-side pieces, only `host-adapter`'s public surface,
 * and talks to the Guardian only over HTTP, through the client role
 * `createGuardianClient` returns.
 *
 * Claude Code's hook protocol (see docs/demos/v1-runbook.md): stdin is one
 * JSON object `{ session_id, transcript_path, cwd, hook_event_name, tool_name,
 * tool_input }`; stdout is one JSON object
 * `{ hookSpecificOutput: { hookEventName, permissionDecision, ... } }`;
 * the process **always exits 0** for a real decision -- "deny" travels in
 * the JSON body, not the exit code. Exit 2 means "blocking error" to
 * Claude Code and exit 1 means "non-blocking error"; neither is how a
 * policy deny is expressed, so getting this wrong would make a deny look
 * like a crash.
 *
 * On failure there are exactly two exit shapes, never a third.
 *
 *   - Exit 2 ("blocking error"), stderr only, empty stdout: this shim
 *     cannot trust its own input or its own configuration enough to make a
 *     governed decision at all -- stdin is not JSON, the payload is missing
 *     a string `hook_event_name`/`session_id`, the hookmap fails to load,
 *     or `session_id` is unsafe to use as a path segment. Every one of
 *     those is a broken deployment, not a policy question, and a loud,
 *     blocking stop beats a silent, ungoverned proceed.
 *
 *     Exit 1 never appears anywhere in this file, including for anything
 *     unexpected that escapes `main`. Claude Code reads exit 1
 *     ("non-blocking error") as "the hook did not fire" and proceeds --
 *     ungoverned and unaudited -- and a governance hook that cannot read
 *     its own input has no honest reason to prefer "proceed" to "block". A
 *     `session_id` that is present but unsafe already blocks (the case just
 *     above); treating a missing `session_id` any differently would put two
 *     members of the same class -- "this deployment's `session_id` cannot
 *     be used" -- on opposite sides of the fail-open/fail-closed line.
 *   - Exit 0, a decision on stdout: every remaining case, with no
 *     exception. A Guardian that is down, a response carrying an error
 *     instead of a decision, a request that times out, or a decision this
 *     host cannot even render (an unrecognised decision string, or a
 *     hookmap gap) all leave this hook with nothing it can honour. A
 *     `deny` that arrives is honoured regardless of what follows, and a
 *     delivery failure never gets dressed up as one. Every such failure is
 *     resolved by the deployment's own negotiated `on_decision_failure`
 *     posture (`applyFailurePosture`) -- proceed or deny -- and every
 *     fail-open `proceed` taken this way is written to the audit log
 *     first, so the bypass is visible rather than silent. The posture's
 *     own "allow"/"deny" is guaranteed renderable: loadHookmap doesn't just
 *     require both to exist in every hookmap's `decisions` block, it
 *     shape-checks every entry it accepts, and `assertHostAcceptsEveryDecision`
 *     below then checks each accepted value against what Claude Code honours
 *     at that event -- so this tier can never recurse into itself, and
 *     can never emit a value the host will silently discard.
 *
 *     They are resolved the same way; they are not recorded as the same
 *     thing. The posture takes one of three `stage`s (failure-posture.ts's
 *     FailureStage), because "no request was ever built", "a request went
 *     out and nothing came back", and "a decision arrived and this host
 *     could not express it" are three different incidents, and an audit
 *     entry that files one under another sends an incident review to the
 *     wrong process. Which stage a failure belongs to is `governStep`'s to
 *     know -- each stage is its own guarded step there, so the stage is
 *     wherever the failure was caught, not something re-inferred afterwards
 *     from leftover variables.

 *     -- so refusing an empty output there would exit 2 on every clean tool
 *     call. Its `deny` is the one that needs checking instead, because `block`
 *     alone reports a withholding that never happened.
 *
 * Neither refusal is relaxed; each is asked of the gate it belongs to. A hook

  // re-deriving it from an `instanceof` and an `error.config`.
  //
  // metadata.session_id is schema-constrained to "uuid" (the same rule
  // buildEnvelope's own toSessionUuid honours); the store itself keys on the
  // raw host session_id, per the session config store's own contract.
  // agentId is the hookmap's own `host` field -- the same identity
  // buildEnvelope sends for the step call, so the two never diverge.
  // Bounded by the ACS default timeout: there is no
  // negotiated timeout yet, since negotiating one is what this call is for --
  // without a bound, a Guardian that accepts the connection and never answers
  // would hang this hook until Claude Code's own hook timeout kills the

  // decision, honours whatever arrives, and renders it -- answering any failure
  // along the way with this session's negotiated posture, audited, at the stage
  // that failed. There are exactly two ways it can end, and both are handled
  // here: an output to write, or a throw that reaches `main().catch` and exits
  // 2. Which stage a failure belongs to, and what response the failure-mode
  // rules produce for it, is stated once inside `governStep`, host-agnostically,
  // so a second host inherits it by calling the function rather than
  // reimplementing it.

  // cannot trust its input or its configuration) or something unforeseen
  // escaping `main` -- and in both cases the honest answer to "should this
  // tool call run?" is "this hook cannot say", which Claude Code must read
  // as a block, not as the hook never having fired.
